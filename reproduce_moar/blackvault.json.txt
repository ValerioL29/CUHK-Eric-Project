    "content": "Case File Status: Probable Hoax- Photos Digitally Manipulated and/or EnhancedBackgroundThe following case was submitted to The Black Vault / TBV Investigations.  The witness submitted the following testimony:Witness Testimony“I was randomly shooting the moon with my Canon SX60HS which can zoom into craters on the moon. I had it on auto, no particular settings other than 3 shot burst.I did not see the object when I clicked the shutter, it was only later when looking over the images of the day. What I captured I kept to myself, a few friends and family. Posted it to fb twice for some opinions later on.It was only recently that I decided to throw it out there and get some real ideas on what, who and where this came from.Thanks for your help,NAME REMOVEDContinue scrolling for more...** I have added all of the pictured captured in the 3 burst. The times in exif data reflect this.– image with object IMG_6440– images without objects IMG_6441, IMG_6442** I have added the photo to a video and blown it up hereNote from The Black Vault: The video was removed to withhold the witnesses identity. It only was a blow up of the below photographs, so all REAL evidence is maintained in this case file. For reference, here is a blow up of the object (with is a screen shot from the video).The EvidenceThe following photographs were submitted for analysis:UFO Captured on this frame.The Analysisby Michael Kelly, TBV InvestigationsAfter conducting a series of thorough photo forensic methods, a number of discrepancies were found in the photographs submitted by the witness.We list only a few of the examples, though more can be found in the metadata using sophisticated photography software. These examples are sufficient to support our conclusion, and we feel that adding even more additional (and technical) evidence would only assist future digital manipulation of a “UFO” photograph.Problem #1The 3-shot burst mode is not indicated in the time stamp nor the metadata which indicates each shot was separated by a few seconds and not fractions of a second as would be the case in burst mode.ModelShooting ModeSpeedCanon PowerShot SX60 HSAuto-focusApprox. 3.8 shots/sec.Image time stamps19:15:0919:15:1219:15:20It is noted that when the witness was asked about this, they submitted the following, and changed the original submission:“Yep you are right in that they possibly weren’t the pictures I snapped in the burst, I have always assumed they were as I was going from memory out shooting. They were certainly part of the same group of images which I had shot in the burst, however they may have been just straight shots as well.”Problem #2This image array compiles all three images on top of each other, showing no variation in pixels on the moon.The changing position of the moon in the photographs indicates that the camera was being held or pointed in different directions on a tripod. The witness confirmed in follow-up communications that the camera was being held.When comparing all three images pixel for pixel, the moon in each image is identical.With a change of position of the camera, the moon should have slight variations in each photograph. The fact that it does not suggests that the images were digitally modified, copying the same image of the moon into all three photographs.ELA photograph shows signs of digital manipulation, of some kind. When the witness was asked — they said the image was never touched digitally, but the ELA does not support that. (Further details have been omitted from the report for reasons outlined below).Problem #3Camera sensors create a high frequency noise pattern over an entire image.In this photograph the moon and sky have this pattern, but the dot does not.The fact that the dot does not have this pattern suggests that it was digitally inserted into the image.Problem #4Through investigation, the witness was found on Facebook using only publicly available information. Recent (public) posts include one of his own Photoshop works with a hidden “easter egg” that he inserted, wherein he invites his friends to attempt to find it.Other posts highlight his Photoshop skills, along with his web  and graphics design career.It is for this (and other) reasons we decided to strip the name of the “witness” off this report, and post it as Anonymous.ConclusionThese photographs do not stand up to digital scrutiny and therefore must be labeled fraudulent.There is additional information which TBV Investigations has left off this report.  We feel the above information is more than enough to support this conclusion, and we do not aim to enhance digital manipulation techniques.Witness Responds to Digital Manipulation ClaimNote from The Black Vault: In the interest of fairness, the witness responded to our report prior to it being published. They felt the need to respond, and we offered to post their responses here, unedited.This is what they submitted:Let me address your points as we go.#1 – Yes, I was mistaken about the burst, this was addressed and quite frankly I think I was pretty open to the idea I could have been wrong there. I do not see how this was relevant as all shots were taken within seconds of each other. They still reside in the same photo folder as the day I put them on the computer. You will see this in the video I provide.#2 – Pixel Alignment – Please refer to the video, it shows you clearly the photographs are not only originals, but also they have never been touched. This “Impossibility” you speak of must not be that impossible, as I was able to do it without even trying. You can see in the data provided on foto forensics that no extra pixels are present, and if you look closely the object definitely occupies more than one pixel.http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=1ead3a7d9d4460762e5f34d9d97afcc85b24531e.2496806&show=ela#3 – ELA – Well I decided to cover this in my video as well. Just to be clear the video is very informative and I believe it to address all of the issues you brought up. In the video you can see clear signs the photograph is indeed, an original and has never been saved. Not even once. Only copied from the cameras SD Card to the folder on my HDD. Here is the link to the fotoforensics analysis.http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=1ead3a7d9d4460762e5f34d9d97afcc85b24531e.2496806&show=ela#4 – The fact I post Graphics on social media is kind of moot, I am a web designer… This is far from being able to manipulate actual photography… I work with logos and such in a digital environment, my ability to create actual real looking work is beyond my skill grade by a long shot. I am a hobby photographer too, does that mean I am not worthy of capturing an unknown object? I am also a space enthusiast with a love for the moon and sun hence why I shoot them both.The “Technical Tells” you speak of are not there, and I am sure some sort of biased is going into your decision, whether it be my profession, my posting graphics to social media or something else. I think being as transparent as I have, it is quite unfair for you to omit data. I have submitted this photograph and proceeded to follow up with my own research and took the time to post it to you. I think I deserve your findings in totality, as to allow others to openly try and repeat the “Tests” you ran. It is only your team finding problems with the photographs, this including Mufon and independent photographers. The information I am sure will not go over my head.I am curious as to what you think my motives here would be? Why would I go through so much work creating two extra images not even relevant to the photo with the object in it… and as you can see in the video, I would have had to make more than two extra images.I am hoping this solidifies the trust that should be between us, I am open to dialogue and certainly am not trying to be in any way, shape, or form misleading. I didn’t choose to have an object show up in my photo, I am just sharing my experience with you all at The Black Vault. I have no side motives, I’m making no money, I’m not selling prints, I actually allowed for the image to be freely downloaded by the public… (it is still available along with other findings in my google drive, everything is available to everyone, transparency) Does this really sound like a hoax? or just someone trying to share his experience?TBV Investigations Final ResponseIn addition to the above statement, the witness submitted a video.  We assume by their description, they did not want it shared publicly, so we respect that and have not published it. However, we are going to respond, and ultimately leave it for all of the readers of this case to decide.The following is from a third party consultant to TBV Investigations. Their ability for image analysis is highly credible.  We have withheld their identity (unless they give us permission later) to thwart future hoax submissions on who we call upon for help.  Their information below is very detailed, and can speak for itself.  Also, the analyst below did view the video (per the witnesses request to show to our analysts). The time codes referenced are irrelevant since the original response video by the witness is not show, but the analysis is self explanatory.Regarding his video:1. At 2:40, he correctly interprets the ELA result as being uniform. However, he draws an incorrect conclusion at 2:40 when he says that a resave would have removed the white noise. The white noise only gets removed if the picture is a low quality. His picture, as I previously noted, does not appear to be low quality.2. At 5:15, he shows his camera roll.This does not identify the pictures as being original — only that he has them in the same directory.There’s also something interesting:At 5:25, the camera roll shows many moon pictures: 6440-6448, but we only have 6440-6442.Picture 6444, 6445, 6446, and 6447 were visibly altered:6444 was cropped to a square (his canon doesn’t do that), recolored to a teal, and strong vignetting was added. 4665 had different color alterations. Similarly, 6446, 6447, and 6448 were all visibly altered. And this is easy to see from the thumbnail images.This means that the known moon pictures (6440-6442) are sitting in a directory next to other pictures that were definitely altered.3. At 5:38: Viewing metadata from Windows Properties literally proves nothing. In particular, Windows metadata viewer displays fields that do not exist in the file, and omits fields that do exist. See:http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?%2Farchives%2F712-Metadata-Tools-of-the-Trade.htmlBy the same means, at 6:35, he claims that the Microsoft property tab for “Previous Versions” says it was never resaved. However, that only applies to using Microsoft to edit pictures and retain revisioning. Again, it literally proves nothing.4. At 6:55, he zooms in to show no photo manipulation. But again, this proves nothing.5. At 7:20, he shows that the Microsoft properties for the created and modified dates match his claim and have not been edited. However, this just shows the metadata fields. (And it is my claim that the metadata was replaced.)Now, let’s compare his counter-argument with my original findings:Finding #1: Burst mode — alright, he admits he was wrong. We can look past this part.Finding #2: The pictures show the same moon at the exact same orientation relative to the camera. Yet, the moon’s position changed relative to the camera. So he somehow managed to change the angle of the view of the moon, repositioning the moon in the frame, and still kept the exact same moon orientation.This is a fun experiment to try at home: Hold the camera and take 3 pictures of a distant object — each 3 seconds apart. Then align the pictures on the object. The orientation should change. A very small object (only a few pixels in the frame) may appear to keep the orientation. A very large object, like the moon taking up 20% of the frame, should change orientation a little. Even though it is only a little different, this should be a visible difference when you overlay the two pictures and view the difference.Then try the same experiment using a tripod — be sure the move the camera on the tripod a little so the object is not in the same relative location between frames. Again, it will change orientation.And yet, he someone managed to take 3 pictures that all have the moon with the exact same orientation.Here’s a difference-overlay of 6440 and 6442 (11 seconds apart):http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=4a3d92dcda18e048a36bea4871c2b34948246585.2346289&fmt=orig– There is blue sky that exists in 6442 and not 6440 — visible due to aligning the moons.– The UFO stands out because it doesn’t exist in 6442.– There’s a tiny fraction of misalignment along one edge of the moon — likely due to scaling.However, if the moon were rotated even one degree, then we should start seeing that reddish difference edge over most of the moon’s edge and most of the moon’s high-contrast features. We’re just not seeing that.Even more interesting: Save the difference picture, bring it up in Gimp or Photoshop, and apply a histogram equalization to it. If you apply a histogram equalization to the difference picture, then you can see (1) moon features stand out along JPEG compression differences (expected), and (2) there is a dark swath through the moon that goes through both pictures. That dark swath should be a lighting artifact (like a lens flare), but it is in the same place in both pictures, even though the camera “moved” relative to the moon.There’s one other thing that bothers me (and makes me chuckle):In 6440, there is no motion blur. So the object is traveling slower than the shutter speed.A few seconds later, in 6441, it is gone. So a UFO flew into view, sat still for a photo, and then vanished. In order to vanish, it would have to travel more than half the width of the frame in 3 seconds. Assuming it is far away and not in front of the lens, that would require a very fast speed.Now, I’m not claiming that a real extra terrestrial UFO couldn’t travel really fast, but this seems like an amazing coincidence that he photographed it at the brief moment that it came to a stop.Or maybe cloaking? Again — amazing coincidence that he photographed it right at the moment when it was about to put up the cloak.Of course, if it were a blur from an insect that this close the the camera, then that would explain the really fast relative movement.Regarding his written comments:Accepted by MUFON? Good for him. MUFON didn’t contact me about this picture. Had they contacted me, I would have told them the same things I told you.“#4 – The fact I post Graphics on social media is kind of moot, I am a web designer…”Note: You hadn’t told me his name, but I got it from his youtube video.This goes toward skillset. He clearly is capable of doing photo manipulation. This is evident in many of his pubic galleries. For example, his art gallery (LINK REMOVED TO WITHHOLD IDENTITY OF WITNESS) includes a collection of real, altered, and edited photos.What do you think?

These examples are sufficient to support our conclusion, and we feel that adding even more additional (and technical) evidence would only assist future digital manipulation of a “UFO” photograph.Problem #1The 3-shot burst mode is not indicated in the time stamp nor the metadata which indicates each shot was separated by a few seconds and not fractions of a second as would be the case in burst mode.ModelShooting ModeSpeedCanon PowerShot SX60 HSAuto-focusApprox. 3.8 shots/sec.Image time stamps19:15:0919:15:1219:15:20It is noted that when the witness was asked about this, they submitted the following, and changed the original submission:“Yep you are right in that they possibly weren’t the pictures I snapped in the burst, I have always assumed they were as I was going from memory out shooting. They were certainly part of the same group of images which I had shot in the burst, however they may have been just straight shots as well.”Problem #2This image array compiles all three images on top of each other, showing no variation in pixels on the moon.The changing position of the moon in the photographs indicates that the camera was being held or pointed in different directions on a tripod. The witness confirmed in follow-up communications that the camera was being held.When comparing all three images pixel for pixel, the moon in each image is identical.With a change of position of the camera, the moon should have slight variations in each photograph. The fact that it does not suggests that the images were digitally modified, copying the same image of the moon into all three photographs.ELA photograph shows signs of digital manipulation, of some kind. When the witness was asked — they said the image was never touched digitally, but the ELA does not support that. (Further details have been omitted from the report for reasons outlined below).Problem #3Camera sensors create a high frequency noise pattern over an entire image.In this photograph the moon and sky have this pattern, but the dot does not.The fact that the dot does not have this pattern suggests that it was digitally inserted into the image.Problem #4Through investigation, the witness was found on Facebook using only publicly available information. Recent (public) posts include one of his own Photoshop works with a hidden “easter egg” that he inserted, wherein he invites his friends to attempt to find it.Other posts highlight his Photoshop skills, along with his web  and graphics design career.It is for this (and other) reasons we decided to strip the name of the “witness” off this report, and post it as Anonymous.ConclusionThese photographs do not stand up to digital scrutiny and therefore must be labeled fraudulent.There is additional information which TBV Investigations has left off this report.  We feel the above information is more than enough to support this conclusion, and we do not aim to enhance digital manipulation techniques.Witness Responds to Digital Manipulation ClaimNote from The Black Vault: In the interest of fairness, the witness responded to our report prior to it being published. They felt the need to respond, and we offered to post their responses here, unedited.This is what they submitted:Let me address your points as we go.#1 – Yes, I was mistaken about the burst, this was addressed and quite frankly I think I was pretty open to the idea I could have been wrong there. I do not see how this was relevant as all shots were taken within seconds of each other. They still reside in the same photo folder as the day I put them on the computer. You will see this in the video I provide.#2 – Pixel Alignment – Please refer to the video, it shows you clearly the photographs are not only originals, but also they have never been touched. This “Impossibility” you speak of must not be that impossible, as I was able to do it without even trying. You can see in the data provided on foto forensics that no extra pixels are present, and if you look closely the object definitely occupies more than one pixel.http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=1ead3a7d9d4460762e5f34d9d97afcc85b24531e.2496806&show=ela#3 – ELA – Well I decided to cover this in my video as well. Just to be clear the video is very informative and I believe it to address all of the issues you brought up. In the video you can see clear signs the photograph is indeed, an original and has never been saved. Not even once. Only copied from the cameras SD Card to the folder on my HDD. Here is the link to the fotoforensics analysis.http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=1ead3a7d9d4460762e5f34d9d97afcc85b24531e.2496806&show=ela#4 – The fact I post Graphics on social media is kind of moot, I am a web designer… This is far from being able to manipulate actual photography… I work with logos and such in a digital environment, my ability to create actual real looking work is beyond my skill grade by a long shot. I am a hobby photographer too, does that mean I am not worthy of capturing an unknown object? I am also a space enthusiast with a love for the moon and sun hence why I shoot them both.The “Technical Tells” you speak of are not there, and I am sure some sort of biased is going into your decision, whether it be my profession, my posting graphics to social media or something else. I think being as transparent as I have, it is quite unfair for you to omit data. I have submitted this photograph and proceeded to follow up with my own research and took the time to post it to you. I think I deserve your findings in totality, as to allow others to openly try and repeat the “Tests” you ran. It is only your team finding problems with the photographs, this including Mufon and independent photographers. The information I am sure will not go over my head.I am curious as to what you think my motives here would be? Why would I go through so much work creating two extra images not even relevant to the photo with the object in it… and as you can see in the video, I would have had to make more than two extra images.I am hoping this solidifies the trust that should be between us, I am open to dialogue and certainly am not trying to be in any way, shape, or form misleading. I didn’t choose to have an object show up in my photo, I am just sharing my experience with you all at The Black Vault. I have no side motives, I’m making no money, I’m not selling prints, I actually allowed for the image to be freely downloaded by the public… (it is still available along with other findings in my google drive, everything is available to everyone, transparency) Does this really sound like a hoax? or just someone trying to share his experience?TBV Investigations Final ResponseIn addition to the above statement, the witness submitted a video.  We assume by their description, they did not want it shared publicly, so we respect that and have not published it. However, we are going to respond, and ultimately leave it for all of the readers of this case to decide.The following is from a third party consultant to TBV Investigations. Their ability for image analysis is highly credible.  We have withheld their identity (unless they give us permission later) to thwart future hoax submissions on who we call upon for help.  Their information below is very detailed, and can speak for itself.  Also, the analyst below did view the video (per the witnesses request to show to our analysts). The time codes referenced are irrelevant since the original response video by the witness is not show, but the analysis is self explanatory.Regarding his video:1. At 2:40, he correctly interprets the ELA result as being uniform. However, he draws an incorrect conclusion at 2:40 when he says that a resave would have removed the white noise. The white noise only gets removed if the picture is a low quality. His picture, as I previously noted, does not appear to be low quality.2. At 5:15, he shows his camera roll.This does not identify the pictures as being original — only that he has them in the same directory.There’s also something interesting:At 5:25, the camera roll shows many moon pictures: 6440-6448, but we only have 6440-6442.Picture 6444, 6445, 6446, and 6447 were visibly altered:6444 was cropped to a square (his canon doesn’t do that), recolored to a teal, and strong vignetting was added. 4665 had different color alterations. Similarly, 6446, 6447, and 6448 were all visibly altered. And this is easy to see from the thumbnail images.This means that the known moon pictures (6440-6442) are sitting in a directory next to other pictures that were definitely altered.3. At 5:38: Viewing metadata from Windows Properties literally proves nothing. In particular, Windows metadata viewer displays fields that do not exist in the file, and omits fields that do exist. See:http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?%2Farchives%2F712-Metadata-Tools-of-the-Trade.htmlBy the same means, at 6:35, he claims that the Microsoft property tab for “Previous Versions” says it was never resaved. However, that only applies to using Microsoft to edit pictures and retain revisioning. Again, it literally proves nothing.4. At 6:55, he zooms in to show no photo manipulation. But again, this proves nothing.5. At 7:20, he shows that the Microsoft properties for the created and modified dates match his claim and have not been edited. However, this just shows the metadata fields. (And it is my claim that the metadata was replaced.)Now, let’s compare his counter-argument with my original findings:Finding #1: Burst mode — alright, he admits he was wrong. We can look past this part.Finding #2: The pictures show the same moon at the exact same orientation relative to the camera. Yet, the moon’s position changed relative to the camera. So he somehow managed to change the angle of the view of the moon, repositioning the moon in the frame, and still kept the exact same moon orientation.This is a fun experiment to try at home: Hold the camera and take 3 pictures of a distant object — each 3 seconds apart. Then align the pictures on the object. The orientation should change. A very small object (only a few pixels in the frame) may appear to keep the orientation. A very large object, like the moon taking up 20% of the frame, should change orientation a little. Even though it is only a little different, this should be a visible difference when you overlay the two pictures and view the difference.Then try the same experiment using a tripod — be sure the move the camera on the tripod a little so the object is not in the same relative location between frames. Again, it will change orientation.And yet, he someone managed to take 3 pictures that all have the moon with the exact same orientation.Here’s a difference-overlay of 6440 and 6442 (11 seconds apart):http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=4a3d92dcda18e048a36bea4871c2b34948246585.2346289&fmt=orig– There is blue sky that exists in 6442 and not 6440 — visible due to aligning the moons.– The UFO stands out because it doesn’t exist in 6442.– There’s a tiny fraction of misalignment along one edge of the moon — likely due to scaling.However, if the moon were rotated even one degree, then we should start seeing that reddish difference edge over most of the moon’s edge and most of the moon’s high-contrast features. We’re just not seeing that.Even more interesting: Save the difference picture, bring it up in Gimp or Photoshop, and apply a histogram equalization to it. If you apply a histogram equalization to the difference picture, then you can see (1) moon features stand out along JPEG compression differences (expected), and (2) there is a dark swath through the moon that goes through both pictures. That dark swath should be a lighting artifact (like a lens flare), but it is in the same place in both pictures, even though the camera “moved” relative to the moon.There’s one other thing that bothers me (and makes me chuckle):In 6440, there is no motion blur. So the object is traveling slower than the shutter speed.A few seconds later, in 6441, it is gone. So a UFO flew into view, sat still for a photo, and then vanished. In order to vanish, it would have to travel more than half the width of the frame in 3 seconds. Assuming it is far away and not in front of the lens, that would require a very fast speed.Now, I’m not claiming that a real extra terrestrial UFO couldn’t travel really fast, but this seems like an amazing coincidence that he photographed it at the brief moment that it came to a stop.Or maybe cloaking? Again — amazing coincidence that he photographed it right at the moment when it was about to put up the cloak.Of course, if it were a blur from an insect that this close the the camera, then that would explain the really fast relative movement.Regarding his written comments:Accepted by MUFON? Good for him. MUFON didn’t contact me about this picture. Had they contacted me, I would have told them the same things I told you.“#4 – The fact I post Graphics on social media is kind of moot, I am a web designer…”Note: You hadn’t told me his name, but I got it from his youtube video.This goes toward skillset. He clearly is capable of doing photo manipulation. This is evident in many of his pubic galleries. For example, his art gallery (LINK REMOVED TO WITHHOLD IDENTITY OF WITNESS) includes a collection of real, altered, and edited photos.What do you think?

    "content": "BackgroundOn January 2, 2011, 6:30 p.m. a glowing metallic sphere was observed to shoot up to the sky from the witnesses back yard. On the ground two circular marks approximately 9 inches in diameter and side by side were noted on the grass where the object had apparently been in contact. The eastern spot (Site A) appeared to suffer a bleaching effect, i.e. was an off-white color. The western spot (Site B) appeared to be burned from top down.ConclusionsNo unusual anomalies were detected in the vegetation and soil samples from contact site A.

A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nOn January 2, 2011, 6:30 p.m. a glowing metallic sphere was observed to shoot up to the sky from the witnesses back yard. On the ground two circular marks approximately 9 inches in diameter and side by side were noted on the grass where the object had apparently been in contact. The eastern spot (Site A) appeared to suffer a bleaching effect, i.e. was an off-white color. The western spot (Site B) appeared to be burned from top down.\nConclusions:\n.No unusual anomalies were detected in the vegetation and soil samples from contact site A. They are similar to the control vegetation and soil samples, and no differences were noted.\n.Some vegetation from the contact site B was found to be burned. However, the soil was normal, showing no heat effects. So, the heat was localized and not hot enough to cause any changes to the soil. The source of the heat is indicated to originate from the sphere. It is speculated that either the sphere was hot, or that there was an energy field around it that induced the vegetation to burn. There was more inorganic nitrate in this soil sample, but this may be from uneven fertilizer application. Another possibility is that if the sphere had an ionizing energy field around it, then interaction with the air may have produced nitrates.\n.The so-called 'ash' is actually plant/grass fines. No unusual anomalies are detected.\n.No radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nSamples: The following samples were received on January 7, 2010. They were sampled from the sites A and B on 1-6-2011 at 5:50 p.m., and placed in Ziploc bags. They are:\n.#1 - Trace Evidence A - Vegetation .#2 - Trace Evidence A - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#3 - Trace Evidence B - Vegetation\n.#4 - Trace Evidence B - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#5 - Control Location - Vegetation\n.#6 - Control Location - Soil, Organic Layer .#8 - Trace Evidence A - Composite Sample .#10 - Trace Evidence B - Composite Sample\nThe next sample was taken on 1-3-2011 at 6:40 p.m., and received January 13, 2011. It was submitted in a plastic vial.\n.#11 - Ash (Identified as \"powdery ash from the ground.\")\nFT-IR (Fourier Transform - Infrared) spectra1 were obtained from all the samples 'as received'. Additionally, water extracts were done on all samples. Spectra were acquired from the water soluble residues. These spectra were obtained on Thermo Electron's 360 Avatar FT-IR spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The samples were also examined with a radiation meter and a UV light.\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on page 1 of this report. It should be noted at this point that no radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe compositions of the control samples are discussed first. The analysis is necessary for comparison to those in contact with the sphere. It is important to note any differences. Multiple infrared spectra were obtained from all samples.\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

They show typical celluloidal material, silicate mineral (dirt) and calcium carbonate mineral. Some long chain natural ester is indicated.

A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nOn January 2, 2011, 6:30 p.m. a glowing metallic sphere was observed to shoot up to the sky from the witnesses back yard. On the ground two circular marks approximately 9 inches in diameter and side by side were noted on the grass where the object had apparently been in contact. The eastern spot (Site A) appeared to suffer a bleaching effect, i.e. was an off-white color. The western spot (Site B) appeared to be burned from top down.\nConclusions:\n.No unusual anomalies were detected in the vegetation and soil samples from contact site A. They are similar to the control vegetation and soil samples, and no differences were noted.\n.Some vegetation from the contact site B was found to be burned. However, the soil was normal, showing no heat effects. So, the heat was localized and not hot enough to cause any changes to the soil. The source of the heat is indicated to originate from the sphere. It is speculated that either the sphere was hot, or that there was an energy field around it that induced the vegetation to burn. There was more inorganic nitrate in this soil sample, but this may be from uneven fertilizer application. Another possibility is that if the sphere had an ionizing energy field around it, then interaction with the air may have produced nitrates.\n.The so-called 'ash' is actually plant/grass fines. No unusual anomalies are detected.\n.No radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nSamples: The following samples were received on January 7, 2010. They were sampled from the sites A and B on 1-6-2011 at 5:50 p.m., and placed in Ziploc bags. They are:\n.#1 - Trace Evidence A - Vegetation .#2 - Trace Evidence A - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#3 - Trace Evidence B - Vegetation\n.#4 - Trace Evidence B - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#5 - Control Location - Vegetation\n.#6 - Control Location - Soil, Organic Layer .#8 - Trace Evidence A - Composite Sample .#10 - Trace Evidence B - Composite Sample\nThe next sample was taken on 1-3-2011 at 6:40 p.m., and received January 13, 2011. It was submitted in a plastic vial.\n.#11 - Ash (Identified as \"powdery ash from the ground.\")\nFT-IR (Fourier Transform - Infrared) spectra1 were obtained from all the samples 'as received'. Additionally, water extracts were done on all samples. Spectra were acquired from the water soluble residues. These spectra were obtained on Thermo Electron's 360 Avatar FT-IR spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The samples were also examined with a radiation meter and a UV light.\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on page 1 of this report. It should be noted at this point that no radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe compositions of the control samples are discussed first. The analysis is necessary for comparison to those in contact with the sphere. It is important to note any differences. Multiple infrared spectra were obtained from all samples.\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nOn January 2, 2011, 6:30 p.m. a glowing metallic sphere was observed to shoot up to the sky from the witnesses back yard. On the ground two circular marks approximately 9 inches in diameter and side by side were noted on the grass where the object had apparently been in contact. The eastern spot (Site A) appeared to suffer a bleaching effect, i.e. was an off-white color. The western spot (Site B) appeared to be burned from top down.\nConclusions:\n.No unusual anomalies were detected in the vegetation and soil samples from contact site A. They are similar to the control vegetation and soil samples, and no differences were noted.\n.Some vegetation from the contact site B was found to be burned. However, the soil was normal, showing no heat effects. So, the heat was localized and not hot enough to cause any changes to the soil. The source of the heat is indicated to originate from the sphere. It is speculated that either the sphere was hot, or that there was an energy field around it that induced the vegetation to burn. There was more inorganic nitrate in this soil sample, but this may be from uneven fertilizer application. Another possibility is that if the sphere had an ionizing energy field around it, then interaction with the air may have produced nitrates.\n.The so-called 'ash' is actually plant/grass fines. No unusual anomalies are detected.\n.No radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nSamples: The following samples were received on January 7, 2010. They were sampled from the sites A and B on 1-6-2011 at 5:50 p.m., and placed in Ziploc bags. They are:\n.#1 - Trace Evidence A - Vegetation .#2 - Trace Evidence A - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#3 - Trace Evidence B - Vegetation\n.#4 - Trace Evidence B - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#5 - Control Location - Vegetation\n.#6 - Control Location - Soil, Organic Layer .#8 - Trace Evidence A - Composite Sample .#10 - Trace Evidence B - Composite Sample\nThe next sample was taken on 1-3-2011 at 6:40 p.m., and received January 13, 2011. It was submitted in a plastic vial.\n.#11 - Ash (Identified as \"powdery ash from the ground.\")\nFT-IR (Fourier Transform - Infrared) spectra1 were obtained from all the samples 'as received'. Additionally, water extracts were done on all samples. Spectra were acquired from the water soluble residues. These spectra were obtained on Thermo Electron's 360 Avatar FT-IR spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The samples were also examined with a radiation meter and a UV light.\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on page 1 of this report. It should be noted at this point that no radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe compositions of the control samples are discussed first. The analysis is necessary for comparison to those in contact with the sphere. It is important to note any differences. Multiple infrared spectra were obtained from all samples.\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nControl Samples\nControl Vegetation Sample #5\n5\nTwo infrared spectra taken of the 'as received' vegetation sample are similar to each other. They show typical celluloidal material, silicate mineral (dirt) and calcium carbonate mineral. Some long chain natural ester is indicated. One spectrum shows more mineral 'dirt' matter (calcium carbonate and quartz) than the other.

A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nOn January 2, 2011, 6:30 p.m. a glowing metallic sphere was observed to shoot up to the sky from the witnesses back yard. On the ground two circular marks approximately 9 inches in diameter and side by side were noted on the grass where the object had apparently been in contact. The eastern spot (Site A) appeared to suffer a bleaching effect, i.e. was an off-white color. The western spot (Site B) appeared to be burned from top down.\nConclusions:\n.No unusual anomalies were detected in the vegetation and soil samples from contact site A. They are similar to the control vegetation and soil samples, and no differences were noted.\n.Some vegetation from the contact site B was found to be burned. However, the soil was normal, showing no heat effects. So, the heat was localized and not hot enough to cause any changes to the soil. The source of the heat is indicated to originate from the sphere. It is speculated that either the sphere was hot, or that there was an energy field around it that induced the vegetation to burn. There was more inorganic nitrate in this soil sample, but this may be from uneven fertilizer application. Another possibility is that if the sphere had an ionizing energy field around it, then interaction with the air may have produced nitrates.\n.The so-called 'ash' is actually plant/grass fines. No unusual anomalies are detected.\n.No radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nSamples: The following samples were received on January 7, 2010. They were sampled from the sites A and B on 1-6-2011 at 5:50 p.m., and placed in Ziploc bags. They are:\n.#1 - Trace Evidence A - Vegetation .#2 - Trace Evidence A - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#3 - Trace Evidence B - Vegetation\n.#4 - Trace Evidence B - Soil, Organic Layer\n.#5 - Control Location - Vegetation\n.#6 - Control Location - Soil, Organic Layer .#8 - Trace Evidence A - Composite Sample .#10 - Trace Evidence B - Composite Sample\nThe next sample was taken on 1-3-2011 at 6:40 p.m., and received January 13, 2011. It was submitted in a plastic vial.\n.#11 - Ash (Identified as \"powdery ash from the ground.\")\nFT-IR (Fourier Transform - Infrared) spectra1 were obtained from all the samples 'as received'. Additionally, water extracts were done on all samples. Spectra were acquired from the water soluble residues. These spectra were obtained on Thermo Electron's 360 Avatar FT-IR spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The samples were also examined with a radiation meter and a UV light.\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on page 1 of this report. It should be noted at this point that no radiation above background was detected for any of the samples. Additionally, no material was observed to fluoresce under UV light.\nThe compositions of the control samples are discussed first. The analysis is necessary for comparison to those in contact with the sphere. It is important to note any differences. Multiple infrared spectra were obtained from all samples.\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT073 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective:\nWhite powders identified as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O, have been examined by this laboratory from assorted unusual events occurring in Holland. One powder was associated with the appearance of a ball of light (Technical Service Report: UT009) and three others were found in different crop formations (Technical Service Report: UT055). Another white powder was recently procured from a crop formation which occurred on October 5, 2009 in Hoeven, Holland.

No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\n.The white powder is a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, with an approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. No other components are detected by FT-IR.1 The detection limit for this test is about 0.5% depending on the sample.\n. The powder is the same as encountered in previous Holland events.\n.No evidence for radiation above background, or UV fluorescing material is detected.\nRecommendation:\nAdditional analysis using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy)-(Mass Spectrometry) is recommended. This technique would be used to scan for elements other that those in magnesium carbonate, in order to determine purity, as well as possibly suggest the source of the powder. This test should also be used to determine the isotopic ratios of magnesium. Isotopic ratios would indicate whether the origin of the sample was terrestrial or extra-terrestrial. See the definition in the Appendix.\nProcedure:\nRoughly 0.45 grams of white powder was submitted in a small plastic vial on October 5, 2009. A photograph of the sample follows.\n1/5/09 - Hola found in cropin\nBLT KeseARD\nAn infrared spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The sample was also tested with a SE International Radiation Alert™ Monitor 5 radiation meter\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A photograph was taken of the sample with a Kodak EasyShare CX7430.\nResults:\nInfrared analysis shows the sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum shows this is the same type of material found in other bizarre events.

Page 6\nAPPENDIX\nElemental Isotopic Analysis Definition\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 7\nElemental Isotopic Analysis\nIsotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\n---- Read from page #1 ----\nPage width: 8.5 inch; height: 11.0 inch\n...

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective:\nWhite powders identified as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O, have been examined by this laboratory from assorted unusual events occurring in Holland. One powder was associated with the appearance of a ball of light (Technical Service Report: UT009) and three others were found in different crop formations (Technical Service Report: UT055). Another white powder was recently procured from a crop formation which occurred on October 5, 2009 in Hoeven, Holland. A photograph of the powder as found in the formation follows.\nWhite material, as found, in field. Photo: Roy Boschman.\nFollowing is a diagram of the formation.

Diagram: Roy Boschman\nThe objective of this analysis is to identify this powder, and determine if it is the same as those previously encountered.\nConclusions:\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\n.The white powder is a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, with an approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. No other components are detected by FT-IR.1 The detection limit for this test is about 0.5% depending on the sample.\n. The powder is the same as encountered in previous Holland events.\n.No evidence for radiation above background, or UV fluorescing material is detected.\nRecommendation:\nAdditional analysis using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy)-(Mass Spectrometry) is recommended. This technique would be used to scan for elements other that those in magnesium carbonate, in order to determine purity, as well as possibly suggest the source of the powder. This test should also be used to determine the isotopic ratios of magnesium. Isotopic ratios would indicate whether the origin of the sample was terrestrial or extra-terrestrial. See the definition in the Appendix.\nProcedure:\nRoughly 0.45 grams of white powder was submitted in a small plastic vial on October 5, 2009. A photograph of the sample follows.\n1/5/09 - Hola found in cropin\nBLT KeseARD\nAn infrared spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The sample was also tested with a SE International Radiation Alert™ Monitor 5 radiation meter\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A photograph was taken of the sample with a Kodak EasyShare CX7430.\nResults:\nInfrared analysis shows the sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum shows this is the same type of material found in other bizarre events.

Page 6\nAPPENDIX\nElemental Isotopic Analysis Definition\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 7\nElemental Isotopic Analysis\nIsotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\n---- Read from page #1 ----\nPage width: 8.5 inch; height: 11.0 inch\n...

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nA white powder found in a crop formation in Holland (October 5, 2009) was identified by this laboratory as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. In the analytical report (Technical Service Report: UT069) a recommendation was made to do additional ICP-MS analysis to determine both the magnesium isotopic ratios1 and purity. More of the sample was submitted on February 24, 2010 from this event to do the recommended analysis.\nConclusions:\n.The white powder is confirmed by FT-IR2 to be the same hydrated form of magnesium carbonate (approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O) as the previous sample received October 5, 2009.\n1 Isotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT071 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\n.ICP/MS shows the isotopic ratios of magnesium are normal for terrestrial magnesium.\n.The ICP elemental results show the magnesium carbonate is 99.99% pure. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which appears to be about 85% purity (http://www.sangamproducts.com/Magnesium.html). Magnesium carbonate at this 99.99% purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom. Alfa Aesar sells 99.996% pure magnesium carbonate at $717.00 per 100 grams (http://www.alfa.com/en/GP100w.pgm?DSSTK=010796). This is rather expensive, but copious amounts of this material have been recovered from various formations and other bizarre events.3\n.What is puzzling is that material recovered from an open field should have evidence of contamination with airborne dust particles. Of course, one could argue that the dust would only be on the surface, so if the sample were taken from the center of the pile, one might avoid contamination. But if one just shoveled the material into a bucket, one would expect mixing.\nProcedure:\nMore white powder from the October 5, 2009 crop formation in Holland was submitted on February 24, 2010. An infrared spectrum was obtained of the new sampling to confirm it was the same material as submitted on October 5, 2009. The spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nThe sample was then sent for ICP-MS analysis to \"ICP and ICP/MS Services\". Magnesium isotopic analysis and a survey elemental analysis for purity were requested.\nResults:\nInfrared Analysis\nInfrared analysis shows the new sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum matches that of the sampling received October 5, 2009. Following are spectra of the new sample, along with those of the older sample and a reference of the (basic) form of magnesium carbonate for comparison.\n3 http://www.bltresearch.com/\nT. S. R.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nA white powder found in a crop formation in Holland (October 5, 2009) was identified by this laboratory as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. In the analytical report (Technical Service Report: UT069) a recommendation was made to do additional ICP-MS analysis to determine both the magnesium isotopic ratios1 and purity. More of the sample was submitted on February 24, 2010 from this event to do the recommended analysis.\nConclusions:\n.The white powder is confirmed by FT-IR2 to be the same hydrated form of magnesium carbonate (approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O) as the previous sample received October 5, 2009.\n1 Isotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT071 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\n.ICP/MS shows the isotopic ratios of magnesium are normal for terrestrial magnesium.\n.The ICP elemental results show the magnesium carbonate is 99.99% pure. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which appears to be about 85% purity (http://www.sangamproducts.com/Magnesium.html). Magnesium carbonate at this 99.99% purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom. Alfa Aesar sells 99.996% pure magnesium carbonate at $717.00 per 100 grams (http://www.alfa.com/en/GP100w.pgm?DSSTK=010796). This is rather expensive, but copious amounts of this material have been recovered from various formations and other bizarre events.3\n.What is puzzling is that material recovered from an open field should have evidence of contamination with airborne dust particles. Of course, one could argue that the dust would only be on the surface, so if the sample were taken from the center of the pile, one might avoid contamination. But if one just shoveled the material into a bucket, one would expect mixing.\nProcedure:\nMore white powder from the October 5, 2009 crop formation in Holland was submitted on February 24, 2010. An infrared spectrum was obtained of the new sampling to confirm it was the same material as submitted on October 5, 2009. The spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nThe sample was then sent for ICP-MS analysis to \"ICP and ICP/MS Services\". Magnesium isotopic analysis and a survey elemental analysis for purity were requested.\nResults:\nInfrared Analysis\nInfrared analysis shows the new sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum matches that of the sampling received October 5, 2009. Following are spectra of the new sample, along with those of the older sample and a reference of the (basic) form of magnesium carbonate for comparison.\n3 http://www.bltresearch.com/\nT. S. R.

The only other element detected by ICP is calcium at 10-100ppm. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which is about 85% purity.4 Magnesium carbonate at this purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective:\nWhite powders identified as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O, have been examined by this laboratory from assorted unusual events occurring in Holland. One powder was associated with the appearance of a ball of light (Technical Service Report: UT009) and three others were found in different crop formations (Technical Service Report: UT055). Another white powder was recently procured from a crop formation which occurred on October 5, 2009 in Hoeven, Holland.

No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\n.The white powder is a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, with an approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. No other components are detected by FT-IR.1 The detection limit for this test is about 0.5% depending on the sample.\n. The powder is the same as encountered in previous Holland events.\n.No evidence for radiation above background, or UV fluorescing material is detected.\nRecommendation:\nAdditional analysis using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy)-(Mass Spectrometry) is recommended. This technique would be used to scan for elements other that those in magnesium carbonate, in order to determine purity, as well as possibly suggest the source of the powder. This test should also be used to determine the isotopic ratios of magnesium. Isotopic ratios would indicate whether the origin of the sample was terrestrial or extra-terrestrial. See the definition in the Appendix.\nProcedure:\nRoughly 0.45 grams of white powder was submitted in a small plastic vial on October 5, 2009. A photograph of the sample follows.\n1/5/09 - Hola found in cropin\nBLT KeseARD\nAn infrared spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The sample was also tested with a SE International Radiation Alert™ Monitor 5 radiation meter\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A photograph was taken of the sample with a Kodak EasyShare CX7430.\nResults:\nInfrared analysis shows the sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum shows this is the same type of material found in other bizarre events.

Page 6\nAPPENDIX\nElemental Isotopic Analysis Definition\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 7\nElemental Isotopic Analysis\nIsotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\n---- Read from page #1 ----\nPage width: 8.5 inch; height: 11.0 inch\n...

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective:\nWhite powders identified as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O, have been examined by this laboratory from assorted unusual events occurring in Holland. One powder was associated with the appearance of a ball of light (Technical Service Report: UT009) and three others were found in different crop formations (Technical Service Report: UT055). Another white powder was recently procured from a crop formation which occurred on October 5, 2009 in Hoeven, Holland. A photograph of the powder as found in the formation follows.\nWhite material, as found, in field. Photo: Roy Boschman.\nFollowing is a diagram of the formation.

Diagram: Roy Boschman\nThe objective of this analysis is to identify this powder, and determine if it is the same as those previously encountered.\nConclusions:\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\n.The white powder is a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, with an approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. No other components are detected by FT-IR.1 The detection limit for this test is about 0.5% depending on the sample.\n. The powder is the same as encountered in previous Holland events.\n.No evidence for radiation above background, or UV fluorescing material is detected.\nRecommendation:\nAdditional analysis using ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy)-(Mass Spectrometry) is recommended. This technique would be used to scan for elements other that those in magnesium carbonate, in order to determine purity, as well as possibly suggest the source of the powder. This test should also be used to determine the isotopic ratios of magnesium. Isotopic ratios would indicate whether the origin of the sample was terrestrial or extra-terrestrial. See the definition in the Appendix.\nProcedure:\nRoughly 0.45 grams of white powder was submitted in a small plastic vial on October 5, 2009. A photograph of the sample follows.\n1/5/09 - Hola found in cropin\nBLT KeseARD\nAn infrared spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. The sample was also tested with a SE International Radiation Alert™ Monitor 5 radiation meter\n1 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

A photograph was taken of the sample with a Kodak EasyShare CX7430.\nResults:\nInfrared analysis shows the sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum shows this is the same type of material found in other bizarre events.

Page 6\nAPPENDIX\nElemental Isotopic Analysis Definition\nT. S. R. No .: UT069 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 7\nElemental Isotopic Analysis\nIsotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\nDocument contains handwritten content\n---- Read from page #1 ----\nPage width: 8.5 inch; height: 11.0 inch\n...

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nA white powder found in a crop formation in Holland (October 5, 2009) was identified by this laboratory as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. In the analytical report (Technical Service Report: UT069) a recommendation was made to do additional ICP-MS analysis to determine both the magnesium isotopic ratios1 and purity. More of the sample was submitted on February 24, 2010 from this event to do the recommended analysis.\nConclusions:\n.The white powder is confirmed by FT-IR2 to be the same hydrated form of magnesium carbonate (approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O) as the previous sample received October 5, 2009.\n1 Isotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT071 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\n.ICP/MS shows the isotopic ratios of magnesium are normal for terrestrial magnesium.\n.The ICP elemental results show the magnesium carbonate is 99.99% pure. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which appears to be about 85% purity (http://www.sangamproducts.com/Magnesium.html). Magnesium carbonate at this 99.99% purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom. Alfa Aesar sells 99.996% pure magnesium carbonate at $717.00 per 100 grams (http://www.alfa.com/en/GP100w.pgm?DSSTK=010796). This is rather expensive, but copious amounts of this material have been recovered from various formations and other bizarre events.3\n.What is puzzling is that material recovered from an open field should have evidence of contamination with airborne dust particles. Of course, one could argue that the dust would only be on the surface, so if the sample were taken from the center of the pile, one might avoid contamination. But if one just shoveled the material into a bucket, one would expect mixing.\nProcedure:\nMore white powder from the October 5, 2009 crop formation in Holland was submitted on February 24, 2010. An infrared spectrum was obtained of the new sampling to confirm it was the same material as submitted on October 5, 2009. The spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nThe sample was then sent for ICP-MS analysis to \"ICP and ICP/MS Services\". Magnesium isotopic analysis and a survey elemental analysis for purity were requested.\nResults:\nInfrared Analysis\nInfrared analysis shows the new sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum matches that of the sampling received October 5, 2009. Following are spectra of the new sample, along with those of the older sample and a reference of the (basic) form of magnesium carbonate for comparison.\n3 http://www.bltresearch.com/\nT. S. R.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nA white powder found in a crop formation in Holland (October 5, 2009) was identified by this laboratory as a hydrated form of magnesium carbonate, specifically with formula (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O. In the analytical report (Technical Service Report: UT069) a recommendation was made to do additional ICP-MS analysis to determine both the magnesium isotopic ratios1 and purity. More of the sample was submitted on February 24, 2010 from this event to do the recommended analysis.\nConclusions:\n.The white powder is confirmed by FT-IR2 to be the same hydrated form of magnesium carbonate (approximate formula of (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O) as the previous sample received October 5, 2009.\n1 Isotopic (measurements) ratios of the elements can be taken by ICP/MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry) to see if they differ from terrestrial values. An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have two or more isotopic forms. That is, the element may have more or less neutrons. Each neutron has a weight of one. So an isotope with more neutrons weighs more than an isotope with less. The ratios of isotopes for any given element on earth will always be the same, i.e. it's a constant. The theory is that these isotopic ratios might be a result of the elements formation in the earliest phase of our solar system, i.e. they are unique to this system. It is thought that these ratios might vary in other solar systems because the elemental formations may have been different. So, if we find the ratios are not normal as compared to terrestrial elements, then the sample may have an extraterrestrial origin.\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT071 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\n.ICP/MS shows the isotopic ratios of magnesium are normal for terrestrial magnesium.\n.The ICP elemental results show the magnesium carbonate is 99.99% pure. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which appears to be about 85% purity (http://www.sangamproducts.com/Magnesium.html). Magnesium carbonate at this 99.99% purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom. Alfa Aesar sells 99.996% pure magnesium carbonate at $717.00 per 100 grams (http://www.alfa.com/en/GP100w.pgm?DSSTK=010796). This is rather expensive, but copious amounts of this material have been recovered from various formations and other bizarre events.3\n.What is puzzling is that material recovered from an open field should have evidence of contamination with airborne dust particles. Of course, one could argue that the dust would only be on the surface, so if the sample were taken from the center of the pile, one might avoid contamination. But if one just shoveled the material into a bucket, one would expect mixing.\nProcedure:\nMore white powder from the October 5, 2009 crop formation in Holland was submitted on February 24, 2010. An infrared spectrum was obtained of the new sampling to confirm it was the same material as submitted on October 5, 2009. The spectrum was obtained of the sample on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nThe sample was then sent for ICP-MS analysis to \"ICP and ICP/MS Services\". Magnesium isotopic analysis and a survey elemental analysis for purity were requested.\nResults:\nInfrared Analysis\nInfrared analysis shows the new sample is magnesium carbonate, and it appears to be in the basic form, i.e. the chemical structure is (MgCO3)4.Mg(OH)2.5H2O (a close approximate). The spectrum matches that of the sampling received October 5, 2009. Following are spectra of the new sample, along with those of the older sample and a reference of the (basic) form of magnesium carbonate for comparison.\n3 http://www.bltresearch.com/\nT. S. R.

The only other element detected by ICP is calcium at 10-100ppm. The surprising results would suggest that the material is chemically made and/or refined from a natural source. Clearly, at this purity it is beyond agricultural use which is about 85% purity.4 Magnesium carbonate at this purity could be found in a laboratory storeroom.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective: The background as reported in the posted CMS file on the MUFON website1 reads as follows. \"Witness contacted Oregon MUFON Asst. SD regarding an apparent implant removed from right adenoid or other glandular passage in his throat. Object has been secured by Oregon SD and will be submitted for analysis.

The sample is composed of primarily calcium phosphate and a small amount of calcium carbonate. Possibly a very small amount of calcium oxalate could be present. It is 3 millimeters in diameter and weighs 0.0524 grams.\n. These types of calcium deposits (calcifications) can be found throughout the human body and caused by a variety of medical problems. The source is not from a foreign implant.\nProcedure:\nSample: The AFO was received on August 11, 2014. It was wrapped in gauze and tightly sealed in a plastic vial. The FI reports that the object is not radioactive, is not magnetic, does not affect a magnetic compass, and does not appear to emit any significant EMF radiation.\n- Mufon.com\nT. S. R. No .: UT088 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nInfrared analysis was done on the sample as received. The FT-IR (Fourier Transform- Infrared) spectra2 were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Optical microscope photographs were obtained using a Canon A520 digital camera interfaced to a Leica GZ6 microscope. Its size and weight were also determined.\nResults:\nMicroscopic Examination\nMicroscopic examination of the fragment shows an irregular shape and consists mostly of brown material with some white spots. Following are the microscope photographs of the object. The second is taken with a ruler with the scale in millimeters. The object is three millimeters in diameter. Additionally, it was noted to weigh 0.0524 grams.\nMicroscope photographs of the AFO\nReference photographs of some kidney stones3 shown below are very similar in coloring and size to the above AFO.

An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n3 https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images ;_ ylt=AwrBT.XfGOBUonAAAfJXNyoA ;_ ylu=X30DMTBOMW82MjU1BHNIYwNzYwR jb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1NNRTY1NV8x ?_ adv_prop=image&fr=yfp-t-dummy_2-s&sz=all&va=kidney+stone 4 http://www.ehow.com/about_causes-calcium-deposit.html: http://.livestrong.com/article/259570-what -causes-calcium-deposits\nT.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective: The background as reported in the posted CMS file on the MUFON website1 reads as follows. \"Witness contacted Oregon MUFON Asst. SD regarding an apparent implant removed from right adenoid or other glandular passage in his throat. Object has been secured by Oregon SD and will be submitted for analysis. Additional sighting experiences related dating back to approximately 1946 or 1947. These will be described in the complete report.\" The objective is to identify the AFO.\nConclusions:\n. The sample is composed of primarily calcium phosphate and a small amount of calcium carbonate. Possibly a very small amount of calcium oxalate could be present. It is 3 millimeters in diameter and weighs 0.0524 grams.\n. These types of calcium deposits (calcifications) can be found throughout the human body and caused by a variety of medical problems. The source is not from a foreign implant.\nProcedure:\nSample: The AFO was received on August 11, 2014. It was wrapped in gauze and tightly sealed in a plastic vial. The FI reports that the object is not radioactive, is not magnetic, does not affect a magnetic compass, and does not appear to emit any significant EMF radiation.\n- Mufon.com\nT. S. R. No .: UT088 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nInfrared analysis was done on the sample as received. The FT-IR (Fourier Transform- Infrared) spectra2 were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Optical microscope photographs were obtained using a Canon A520 digital camera interfaced to a Leica GZ6 microscope. Its size and weight were also determined.\nResults:\nMicroscopic Examination\nMicroscopic examination of the fragment shows an irregular shape and consists mostly of brown material with some white spots. Following are the microscope photographs of the object. The second is taken with a ruler with the scale in millimeters. The object is three millimeters in diameter. Additionally, it was noted to weigh 0.0524 grams.\nMicroscope photographs of the AFO\nReference photographs of some kidney stones3 shown below are very similar in coloring and size to the above AFO. These types of deposits can crop up any part of the body.4\nkidneystonepictures.com\n5 TD 6\n0\n1cm 2\n3\nReference photographs of kidney stones\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n3 https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images ;_ ylt=AwrBT.XfGOBUonAAAfJXNyoA ;_ ylu=X30DMTBOMW82MjU1BHNIYwNzYwR jb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1NNRTY1NV8x ?_ adv_prop=image&fr=yfp-t-dummy_2-s&sz=all&va=kidney+stone 4 http://www.ehow.com/about_causes-calcium-deposit.html: http://.livestrong.com/article/259570-what -causes-calcium-deposits\nT.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective: The background as reported in the posted CMS file on the MUFON website1 reads as follows. \"Witness contacted Oregon MUFON Asst. SD regarding an apparent implant removed from right adenoid or other glandular passage in his throat. Object has been secured by Oregon SD and will be submitted for analysis.

The sample is composed of primarily calcium phosphate and a small amount of calcium carbonate. Possibly a very small amount of calcium oxalate could be present. It is 3 millimeters in diameter and weighs 0.0524 grams.\n. These types of calcium deposits (calcifications) can be found throughout the human body and caused by a variety of medical problems. The source is not from a foreign implant.\nProcedure:\nSample: The AFO was received on August 11, 2014. It was wrapped in gauze and tightly sealed in a plastic vial. The FI reports that the object is not radioactive, is not magnetic, does not affect a magnetic compass, and does not appear to emit any significant EMF radiation.\n- Mufon.com\nT. S. R. No .: UT088 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nInfrared analysis was done on the sample as received. The FT-IR (Fourier Transform- Infrared) spectra2 were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Optical microscope photographs were obtained using a Canon A520 digital camera interfaced to a Leica GZ6 microscope. Its size and weight were also determined.\nResults:\nMicroscopic Examination\nMicroscopic examination of the fragment shows an irregular shape and consists mostly of brown material with some white spots. Following are the microscope photographs of the object. The second is taken with a ruler with the scale in millimeters. The object is three millimeters in diameter. Additionally, it was noted to weigh 0.0524 grams.\nMicroscope photographs of the AFO\nReference photographs of some kidney stones3 shown below are very similar in coloring and size to the above AFO. These types of deposits can crop up any part of the body.4\nkidneystonepictures.com\n5 TD 6\n0\n1cm 2\n3\nReference photographs of kidney stones\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n3 https://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images ;_ ylt=AwrBT.XfGOBUonAAAfJXNyoA ;_ ylu=X30DMTBOMW82MjU1BHNIYwNzYwR jb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlkA1NNRTY1NV8x ?_ adv_prop=image&fr=yfp-t-dummy_2-s&sz=all&va=kidney+stone 4 http://www.ehow.com/about_causes-calcium-deposit.html: http://.livestrong.com/article/259570-what -causes-calcium-deposits\nT.

A. Budinger Analytical Scientist\nBackground/Objective: The background as reported in the posted CMS file on the MUFON website1 reads as follows. \"Witness contacted Oregon MUFON Asst. SD regarding an apparent implant removed from right adenoid or other glandular passage in his throat. Object has been secured by Oregon SD and will be submitted for analysis. Additional sighting experiences related dating back to approximately 1946 or 1947. These will be described in the complete report.\" The objective is to identify the AFO.\nConclusions:\n. The sample is composed of primarily calcium phosphate and a small amount of calcium carbonate. Possibly a very small amount of calcium oxalate could be present. It is 3 millimeters in diameter and weighs 0.0524 grams.\n. These types of calcium deposits (calcifications) can be found throughout the human body and caused by a variety of medical problems. The source is not from a foreign implant.\nProcedure:\nSample: The AFO was received on August 11, 2014. It was wrapped in gauze and tightly sealed in a plastic vial. The FI reports that the object is not radioactive, is not magnetic, does not affect a magnetic compass, and does not appear to emit any significant EMF radiation.\n- Mufon.com\nT. S. R. No .: UT088 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nInfrared analysis was done on the sample as received. The FT-IR (Fourier Transform- Infrared) spectra2 were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Optical microscope photographs were obtained using a Canon A520 digital camera interfaced to a Leica GZ6 microscope. Its size and weight were also determined.\nResults:\nMicroscopic Examination\nMicroscopic examination of the fragment shows an irregular shape and consists mostly of brown material with some white spots. Following are the microscope photographs of the object. The second is taken with a ruler with the scale in millimeters. The object is three millimeters in diameter. Additionally, it was noted to weigh 0.0524 grams.\nMicroscope photographs of the AFO\nReference photographs of some kidney stones3 shown below are very similar in coloring and size to the above AFO.

    "content": "Case File Status: Likely Explainable (see below); Still OngoingBackgroundThe attached photograph was allegedly “leaked” to the public, and represents an example of a photo within an official Department of Defense (DOD) report on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. It was obtained by anonymous sources, and published byTheDebriefon December 3, 2020.The full story can be viewed at the below presentation by The Black Vault.The PhotographContinue scrolling for more...Below, you will find the metadata of the photograph. It was surprising what appeared to be the “original” copy of the photo was used, holding the metadata that the photograph was taken in 2019, rather than the reported 2018. It was explained by the author of the piece, Tim McMillan, that it represented a “photo of a photo” and was not the original photograph. However, that seems to bein dispute.However, after publication, the original version with the metadata was altered and scaled up, thus removing the metadata. Therefore, since the photograph is allegedly from a U.S. military document, it is believe to have no copyright, so the original is archived here for safe-keeping.Technical Breakdown of the OriginalThe original was first published on a CDN atthis URLand embedded into The Debrief’s article.This version was used as the top representation of the photo when the article was first published. Sometime thereafter, but prior to December 7, the photo was upscaled and the original is no longer embedded in the article.  It still appears on “Stack Path” as of the writing of this, last checked on December 7, but is not currently located on The Debrief anymore.This can be verified via a second source at:Wayback Machine.You will note now the appendage of “-scaled” is added to the file name, thus indicating an edit and subsequent stripping of the metadata from the original.The ORIGINAL of that one, which also holds metadata, is found atthis URL.This was an even larger size than the one embedded. This is also in the .zip file below. (Thank you to Reddit userpomegranatemagnatefor pointing out the original to the original.)In order to download the original photos, unaltered the way TheDebrief published it with metadata attached, you need to download the following .zip file which contains the original “photo-2-1.jpg” and“photo-2-1-2048×1536.jpg” images as posted by The Debrief.DOWNLOAD[.zip, 1MB]The MysteryTo add to the mystery, the photo in question was actually published actually MONTHS earlier, byBlake S. Taylor, on Twitter.#ufotwitter#paranormaltwitterpic.twitter.com/LlIFEk3wVf— Blake S. Taylor Investigations 🚫 (@YoungGun8140)May 12, 2020The Black Vault reached out to Blake, and he stated he simply recalls downloading it from a site on the internet. He is unable to recall which one. He also posted a public comment explaining the same, wherein he said the following:“Hey man, I’m pretty sure I found it while rummaging around in one of those sites where we find government documents etc. I’ve been trying to remember it’s been a while. I just remember seeing it saving it and sharing it.”The Explanation?Very quickly, an explanation circulated the social media channels where stories like this are possible. The shape of the object, and a subsequent style of balloon, are strikingly similar.The debate has commenced on whether this was too high for a mylar balloon, but it appears that with the “rough” estimate of altitude of the object in the article, combined with multiplesourcesoutlining how high a mylar balloon can go, it is definitely in the ballpark and possible.https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoV5-yJWEAEnuXh.mp4The SourceWith permission, I’ve added here a likely source of the photo, regardless of if the object is a balloon or not.

It was obtained by anonymous sources, and published byTheDebriefon December 3, 2020.The full story can be viewed at the below presentation by The Black Vault.The PhotographContinue scrolling for more...Below, you will find the metadata of the photograph. It was surprising what appeared to be the “original” copy of the photo was used, holding the metadata that the photograph was taken in 2019, rather than the reported 2018. It was explained by the author of the piece, Tim McMillan, that it represented a “photo of a photo” and was not the original photograph. However, that seems to bein dispute.However, after publication, the original version with the metadata was altered and scaled up, thus removing the metadata. Therefore, since the photograph is allegedly from a U.S. military document, it is believe to have no copyright, so the original is archived here for safe-keeping.Technical Breakdown of the OriginalThe original was first published on a CDN atthis URLand embedded into The Debrief’s article.This version was used as the top representation of the photo when the article was first published. Sometime thereafter, but prior to December 7, the photo was upscaled and the original is no longer embedded in the article.  It still appears on “Stack Path” as of the writing of this, last checked on December 7, but is not currently located on The Debrief anymore.This can be verified via a second source at:Wayback Machine.You will note now the appendage of “-scaled” is added to the file name, thus indicating an edit and subsequent stripping of the metadata from the original.The ORIGINAL of that one, which also holds metadata, is found atthis URL.This was an even larger size than the one embedded. This is also in the .zip file below. (Thank you to Reddit userpomegranatemagnatefor pointing out the original to the original.)In order to download the original photos, unaltered the way TheDebrief published it with metadata attached, you need to download the following .zip file which contains the original “photo-2-1.jpg” and“photo-2-1-2048×1536.jpg” images as posted by The Debrief.DOWNLOAD[.zip, 1MB]The MysteryTo add to the mystery, the photo in question was actually published actually MONTHS earlier, byBlake S. Taylor, on Twitter.#ufotwitter#paranormaltwitterpic.twitter.com/LlIFEk3wVf— Blake S. Taylor Investigations 🚫 (@YoungGun8140)May 12, 2020The Black Vault reached out to Blake, and he stated he simply recalls downloading it from a site on the internet. He is unable to recall which one. He also posted a public comment explaining the same, wherein he said the following:“Hey man, I’m pretty sure I found it while rummaging around in one of those sites where we find government documents etc. I’ve been trying to remember it’s been a while. I just remember seeing it saving it and sharing it.”The Explanation?Very quickly, an explanation circulated the social media channels where stories like this are possible. The shape of the object, and a subsequent style of balloon, are strikingly similar.The debate has commenced on whether this was too high for a mylar balloon, but it appears that with the “rough” estimate of altitude of the object in the article, combined with multiplesourcesoutlining how high a mylar balloon can go, it is definitely in the ballpark and possible.https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoV5-yJWEAEnuXh.mp4The SourceWith permission, I’ve added here a likely source of the photo, regardless of if the object is a balloon or not.

An edited account follows. 1\nThe witness experienced two encounters with a UFO over a two-day period, i.e. early August 24 and early August 25, 2005. It involved a couple traveling from Eagle rock, Missouri to a small camping park near Marion, Ohio. The first encounter was near Indianapolis, IN while traveling east on I-70.

She used to work for DOW Chemical and is quite familiar with chemical odors. After continuing to drive east on I-70 the couple stopped for fuel near the Indiana-Ohio Border (Richmond, Indiana). The woman saw several lights in the sky and became sick again with the same \"foul\" odor. The next night while driving on U.S. Highway 61 near Mount Gilead, Ohio she sighted a large triangular object. She again smelled the same strong odor and felt a \"mist-like\" substance on her skin. She had just purchased a new pair of black boots. They were marketed by Wal-Mart, but she purchased them new from a second party. She said she had never worn the boots before the trip. The synthetic suede on the surface of the boots was stripped clean in several areas after her encounters. She said that a \"black substance\" collected on the carpet of a relative that she was visiting right after the encounter.\n1 The account can also be found in the following website: www.ufosnw.com/ind-oh-aug2005.htm.\nT.

The doctor's diagnosis was \"chemical pneumonia\" and kidney infection.\nThe objective is to examine a boot worn during the events to determine whether there are any residues that may relate to the suede to being stripped clean in various areas.

The boot is covered with fake suede, i.e. poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). The outer surface of the suede also has some polydimethylsiloxane which is commonly used as a water repellent. Soil particulates are present on the sole and heel of the boot.

Though not analyzed, I speculate the black substance reported to be on the relative's carpet was also some of the boot material, specifically a poly(ester urethane, MBI.\n4.) It is most unusual that the suede came off of the boot. With the absence of any unusual foreign substances, I can offer two speculations why this occurred. They follow.\n. The witness described a creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar odor during the event. This is an important clue. Creosol contains phenolic-type materials\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 4\namong other things. So, this may indicate the presence of phenolics, though not necessary from creosol. If the boot was exposed to these materials, there is a very real possibility they caused the adhesive to fail. According to \"The Polymer Handbook\"2 poly(urethanes), of which the suede and glue are composed, are soluble in phenol, m-cresol (a phenolic derivative), formic acid , and sulfuric acid. Phenols sublime easily and would have been gone by the time the boot was received for analysis, and hence not detected. I can rule out sulfuric acid and formic acid because the pH measurements of the boot surface were neutral and possibly skewed to the basic side. These phenolic materials are hazardous and known to cause some of the effects suffered by the witness.3\n. For the second, less likely speculation, I offer that the boot became wet during the encounter. This caused a loss of adhesiveness due to improper bonding of the urethane glue to the fake suede during manufacture. Partially uncured urethane adhesive was found in the boot.\nProcedure:\nSamples: A black suede boot (left) with bare spots was submitted for analysis. There are also black flecks in a plastic bag that contained the boots when the witness shipped them to the investigator. The samples were received by this laboratory on October 21, 2005.\nInfrared spectra were obtained from of the inside and outside of a piece of suede carefully removed from the boot. Spectra were also obtained from scrapings of the \"bare area\", scrapings from the sole and heel, a tarry material found inside the boot (heel), and flecks found in the bag containing the boot. Spectra were acquired on the Analect 360 spectrometer using the Harrick SplitPea® sampling accessory. Additionally, pH measurements were made by placing dampened pHydrion paper on two areas (the suede and the bare regions) of the boot. The samples were also examined with a radiation monitor (SE International's Radiation Alert™ Monitor 4) and a UV light (Optical Engineering's Model 22-UV).\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on the page three of this report.\n2 E. H. Immergut et al, \"The Polymer Handbook\", Fourth Edition , John Wiley & Sons, Inc. VII/515 (1999).\n3 See websites http://onehomebiz.com/team/familybiz/faq.html and http://www.intox.org/databank/documents/cehemical/phenol/cie29.htm for the effects on exposure to phenolic type materials.\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 5\nInfrared Analysis: Infrared examination of the outside surface of suede carefully removed from the boot shows it is composed of poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate) which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). Also detected is polydimethylsiloxane. This later material is commonly used as a moisture repellent. The infrared spectrum of the inside of the removed suede only detects poly(ester urethane) MBI. Following are spectra of the outside and inside of the suede, along with a reference of poly(ester urethane) MBI for comparison.\nInfrared Spectra of the Outer and Inner Sides of Removed Boot Suede\n100\n*Boot Suede Area Outer Side (Control) file=Boot1h_\n90\n%\n80\nT\n70\n60\nPf\nP\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - OUTER SIDE\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP - IDENTIFIED AS MOSTLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\nS\nP\nS\nPS\n(MBI = methylene bis(phenyl-isocyanate)\nP\nP\nS - SOME POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE\nBoot Suede Area Inner Side (Control) file=Boot2h\n100\n90\n80\n% T\n70\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - INNER SIDE\nIDENTIFIED AS TOTALLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\n60\n50\n3000\n2000\n1500 1000\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n500\nT.

This procedure effectively nulled out the poly(ester urethane) absorption bands. It showed additional absorption due to the siloxane, which matches a reference of polydimethylsiloxane.

S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 10\npH Measurements: The suede and bare areas of the boot were exposed to damp pHydrion paper to determine whether there were any acidic or basic materials present. The test is a rough measurement and shows a pH of 7-8, indicating both areas are neutral or near neutral. So, no highly acidic or basic components are detected. Following is a photograph of the boot with damp pHydrion attached along with the indicator guide. Clearly the yellow color compares to a pH of 7/8.\n7 8 pHydrion lapers 1To12 JUMBO\nQ 10 11 12\nBoot with dampened pHydrion Paper\nOther Tests: Radiation measurements show no radiation above normal background for any of the above samples.

Box 50246 Bellevue, WA 98015-0246\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nThe event is described in the analytical request by William Puckett. An edited account follows. 1\nThe witness experienced two encounters with a UFO over a two-day period, i.e. early August 24 and early August 25, 2005. It involved a couple traveling from Eagle rock, Missouri to a small camping park near Marion, Ohio. The first encounter was near Indianapolis, IN while traveling east on I-70. The woman (primary witness) saw bright flames to the north. She became quite sickened by a strong odor, which was similar to creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar. She used to work for DOW Chemical and is quite familiar with chemical odors. After continuing to drive east on I-70 the couple stopped for fuel near the Indiana-Ohio Border (Richmond, Indiana). The woman saw several lights in the sky and became sick again with the same \"foul\" odor. The next night while driving on U.S. Highway 61 near Mount Gilead, Ohio she sighted a large triangular object. She again smelled the same strong odor and felt a \"mist-like\" substance on her skin. She had just purchased a new pair of black boots. They were marketed by Wal-Mart, but she purchased them new from a second party. She said she had never worn the boots before the trip. The synthetic suede on the surface of the boots was stripped clean in several areas after her encounters. She said that a \"black substance\" collected on the carpet of a relative that she was visiting right after the encounter.\n1 The account can also be found in the following website: www.ufosnw.com/ind-oh-aug2005.htm.\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nThe witness suffered physical effects from the encounters for more than a month. The doctor's diagnosis was \"chemical pneumonia\" and kidney infection.\nThe objective is to examine a boot worn during the events to determine whether there are any residues that may relate to the suede to being stripped clean in various areas. Following are photographs of the left boot which clearly shows the damage to the suede surface.\nPhotographs of the Boot (Left)\nRight Side of Boot\nLeft Side of Boot\nBoot Top\n4\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nBoot Sole/Heel\nBoot Back\nConclusions:\n1.) No unusual materials are detected on the boot. The boot is covered with fake suede, i.e. poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). The outer surface of the suede also has some polydimethylsiloxane which is commonly used as a water repellent. Soil particulates are present on the sole and heel of the boot. There is also a small amount of tarry material inside the boot, which consists of poly(ester urethane) MBI, talc, and a biological material containing an amide functionality. The urethane inside the boot is not completely cured. It is probably the glue that holds the suede to the boot. The talc may be from foot powder, and the amide- containing material may be perspiration. No radioactivity above background is detected.\n2.) Black particulates found in a plastic bag containing the boot are fake suede poly(ester urethane) MBI, obviously from the boot.\n3.) Though not analyzed, I speculate the black substance reported to be on the relative's carpet was also some of the boot material, specifically a poly(ester urethane, MBI.\n4.) It is most unusual that the suede came off of the boot. With the absence of any unusual foreign substances, I can offer two speculations why this occurred. They follow.\n. The witness described a creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar odor during the event. This is an important clue. Creosol contains phenolic-type materials\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 4\namong other things. So, this may indicate the presence of phenolics, though not necessary from creosol. If the boot was exposed to these materials, there is a very real possibility they caused the adhesive to fail. According to \"The Polymer Handbook\"2 poly(urethanes), of which the suede and glue are composed, are soluble in phenol, m-cresol (a phenolic derivative), formic acid , and sulfuric acid. Phenols sublime easily and would have been gone by the time the boot was received for analysis, and hence not detected. I can rule out sulfuric acid and formic acid because the pH measurements of the boot surface were neutral and possibly skewed to the basic side. These phenolic materials are hazardous and known to cause some of the effects suffered by the witness.3\n. For the second, less likely speculation, I offer that the boot became wet during the encounter. This caused a loss of adhesiveness due to improper bonding of the urethane glue to the fake suede during manufacture. Partially uncured urethane adhesive was found in the boot.\nProcedure:\nSamples: A black suede boot (left) with bare spots was submitted for analysis. There are also black flecks in a plastic bag that contained the boots when the witness shipped them to the investigator. The samples were received by this laboratory on October 21, 2005.\nInfrared spectra were obtained from of the inside and outside of a piece of suede carefully removed from the boot. Spectra were also obtained from scrapings of the \"bare area\", scrapings from the sole and heel, a tarry material found inside the boot (heel), and flecks found in the bag containing the boot. Spectra were acquired on the Analect 360 spectrometer using the Harrick SplitPea® sampling accessory. Additionally, pH measurements were made by placing dampened pHydrion paper on two areas (the suede and the bare regions) of the boot. The samples were also examined with a radiation monitor (SE International's Radiation Alert™ Monitor 4) and a UV light (Optical Engineering's Model 22-UV).\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on the page three of this report.\n2 E. H. Immergut et al, \"The Polymer Handbook\", Fourth Edition , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

Also detected is polydimethylsiloxane. This later material is commonly used as a moisture repellent. The infrared spectrum of the inside of the removed suede only detects poly(ester urethane) MBI. Following are spectra of the outside and inside of the suede, along with a reference of poly(ester urethane) MBI for comparison.\nInfrared Spectra of the Outer and Inner Sides of Removed Boot Suede\n100\n*Boot Suede Area Outer Side (Control) file=Boot1h_\n90\n%\n80\nT\n70\n60\nPf\nP\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - OUTER SIDE\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP - IDENTIFIED AS MOSTLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\nS\nP\nS\nPS\n(MBI = methylene bis(phenyl-isocyanate)\nP\nP\nS - SOME POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE\nBoot Suede Area Inner Side (Control) file=Boot2h\n100\n90\n80\n% T\n70\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - INNER SIDE\nIDENTIFIED AS TOTALLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\n60\n50\n3000\n2000\n1500 1000\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n500\nT.

This procedure effectively nulled out the poly(ester urethane) absorption bands. It showed additional absorption due to the siloxane, which matches a reference of polydimethylsiloxane.

An edited account follows. 1\nThe witness experienced two encounters with a UFO over a two-day period, i.e. early August 24 and early August 25, 2005. It involved a couple traveling from Eagle rock, Missouri to a small camping park near Marion, Ohio. The first encounter was near Indianapolis, IN while traveling east on I-70. The woman (primary witness) saw bright flames to the north. She became quite sickened by a strong odor, which was similar to creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar. She used to work for DOW Chemical and is quite familiar with chemical odors. After continuing to drive east on I-70 the couple stopped for fuel near the Indiana-Ohio Border (Richmond, Indiana). The woman saw several lights in the sky and became sick again with the same \"foul\" odor. The next night while driving on U.S. Highway 61 near Mount Gilead, Ohio she sighted a large triangular object. She again smelled the same strong odor and felt a \"mist-like\" substance on her skin. She had just purchased a new pair of black boots. They were marketed by Wal-Mart, but she purchased them new from a second party. She said she had never worn the boots before the trip. The synthetic suede on the surface of the boots was stripped clean in several areas after her encounters. She said that a \"black substance\" collected on the carpet of a relative that she was visiting right after the encounter.\n1 The account can also be found in the following website: www.ufosnw.com/ind-oh-aug2005.htm.\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nThe witness suffered physical effects from the encounters for more than a month. The doctor's diagnosis was \"chemical pneumonia\" and kidney infection.\nThe objective is to examine a boot worn during the events to determine whether there are any residues that may relate to the suede to being stripped clean in various areas. Following are photographs of the left boot which clearly shows the damage to the suede surface.\nPhotographs of the Boot (Left)\nRight Side of Boot\nLeft Side of Boot\nBoot Top\n4\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nBoot Sole/Heel\nBoot Back\nConclusions:\n1.) No unusual materials are detected on the boot. The boot is covered with fake suede, i.e. poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). The outer surface of the suede also has some polydimethylsiloxane which is commonly used as a water repellent. Soil particulates are present on the sole and heel of the boot. There is also a small amount of tarry material inside the boot, which consists of poly(ester urethane) MBI, talc, and a biological material containing an amide functionality. The urethane inside the boot is not completely cured. It is probably the glue that holds the suede to the boot. The talc may be from foot powder, and the amide- containing material may be perspiration. No radioactivity above background is detected.\n2.) Black particulates found in a plastic bag containing the boot are fake suede poly(ester urethane) MBI, obviously from the boot.\n3.) Though not analyzed, I speculate the black substance reported to be on the relative's carpet was also some of the boot material, specifically a poly(ester urethane, MBI.\n4.) It is most unusual that the suede came off of the boot. With the absence of any unusual foreign substances, I can offer two speculations why this occurred. They follow.\n. The witness described a creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar odor during the event. This is an important clue. Creosol contains phenolic-type materials\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 4\namong other things. So, this may indicate the presence of phenolics, though not necessary from creosol. If the boot was exposed to these materials, there is a very real possibility they caused the adhesive to fail. According to \"The Polymer Handbook\"2 poly(urethanes), of which the suede and glue are composed, are soluble in phenol, m-cresol (a phenolic derivative), formic acid , and sulfuric acid. Phenols sublime easily and would have been gone by the time the boot was received for analysis, and hence not detected. I can rule out sulfuric acid and formic acid because the pH measurements of the boot surface were neutral and possibly skewed to the basic side. These phenolic materials are hazardous and known to cause some of the effects suffered by the witness.3\n. For the second, less likely speculation, I offer that the boot became wet during the encounter. This caused a loss of adhesiveness due to improper bonding of the urethane glue to the fake suede during manufacture. Partially uncured urethane adhesive was found in the boot.\nProcedure:\nSamples: A black suede boot (left) with bare spots was submitted for analysis. There are also black flecks in a plastic bag that contained the boots when the witness shipped them to the investigator. The samples were received by this laboratory on October 21, 2005.\nInfrared spectra were obtained from of the inside and outside of a piece of suede carefully removed from the boot. Spectra were also obtained from scrapings of the \"bare area\", scrapings from the sole and heel, a tarry material found inside the boot (heel), and flecks found in the bag containing the boot. Spectra were acquired on the Analect 360 spectrometer using the Harrick SplitPea® sampling accessory. Additionally, pH measurements were made by placing dampened pHydrion paper on two areas (the suede and the bare regions) of the boot. The samples were also examined with a radiation monitor (SE International's Radiation Alert™ Monitor 4) and a UV light (Optical Engineering's Model 22-UV).\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on the page three of this report.\n2 E. H. Immergut et al, \"The Polymer Handbook\", Fourth Edition , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 5\nInfrared Analysis: Infrared examination of the outside surface of suede carefully removed from the boot shows it is composed of poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate) which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). Also detected is polydimethylsiloxane. This later material is commonly used as a moisture repellent. The infrared spectrum of the inside of the removed suede only detects poly(ester urethane) MBI. Following are spectra of the outside and inside of the suede, along with a reference of poly(ester urethane) MBI for comparison.\nInfrared Spectra of the Outer and Inner Sides of Removed Boot Suede\n100\n*Boot Suede Area Outer Side (Control) file=Boot1h_\n90\n%\n80\nT\n70\n60\nPf\nP\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - OUTER SIDE\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP - IDENTIFIED AS MOSTLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\nS\nP\nS\nPS\n(MBI = methylene bis(phenyl-isocyanate)\nP\nP\nS - SOME POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE\nBoot Suede Area Inner Side (Control) file=Boot2h\n100\n90\n80\n% T\n70\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - INNER SIDE\nIDENTIFIED AS TOTALLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\n60\n50\n3000\n2000\n1500 1000\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n500\nT.

This procedure effectively nulled out the poly(ester urethane) absorption bands. It showed additional absorption due to the siloxane, which matches a reference of polydimethylsiloxane.

This enhances absorption from the other component and\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 7\npermits its identification.

The amide- containing material may be from foot perspiration. Generation of a difference spectrum between those of the tarry material and the intact suede (outer side) nulls out the interfering urethane absorption.

The test is a rough measurement and shows a pH of 7-8, indicating both areas are neutral or near neutral. So, no highly acidic or basic components are detected.

Box 50246 Bellevue, WA 98015-0246\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nThe event is described in the analytical request by William Puckett. An edited account follows. 1\nThe witness experienced two encounters with a UFO over a two-day period, i.e. early August 24 and early August 25, 2005. It involved a couple traveling from Eagle rock, Missouri to a small camping park near Marion, Ohio. The first encounter was near Indianapolis, IN while traveling east on I-70. The woman (primary witness) saw bright flames to the north. She became quite sickened by a strong odor, which was similar to creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar. She used to work for DOW Chemical and is quite familiar with chemical odors. After continuing to drive east on I-70 the couple stopped for fuel near the Indiana-Ohio Border (Richmond, Indiana). The woman saw several lights in the sky and became sick again with the same \"foul\" odor. The next night while driving on U.S. Highway 61 near Mount Gilead, Ohio she sighted a large triangular object. She again smelled the same strong odor and felt a \"mist-like\" substance on her skin. She had just purchased a new pair of black boots. They were marketed by Wal-Mart, but she purchased them new from a second party. She said she had never worn the boots before the trip. The synthetic suede on the surface of the boots was stripped clean in several areas after her encounters. She said that a \"black substance\" collected on the carpet of a relative that she was visiting right after the encounter.\n1 The account can also be found in the following website: www.ufosnw.com/ind-oh-aug2005.htm.\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nThe witness suffered physical effects from the encounters for more than a month. The doctor's diagnosis was \"chemical pneumonia\" and kidney infection.\nThe objective is to examine a boot worn during the events to determine whether there are any residues that may relate to the suede to being stripped clean in various areas. Following are photographs of the left boot which clearly shows the damage to the suede surface.\nPhotographs of the Boot (Left)\nRight Side of Boot\nLeft Side of Boot\nBoot Top\n4\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nBoot Sole/Heel\nBoot Back\nConclusions:\n1.) No unusual materials are detected on the boot. The boot is covered with fake suede, i.e. poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). The outer surface of the suede also has some polydimethylsiloxane which is commonly used as a water repellent. Soil particulates are present on the sole and heel of the boot. There is also a small amount of tarry material inside the boot, which consists of poly(ester urethane) MBI, talc, and a biological material containing an amide functionality. The urethane inside the boot is not completely cured. It is probably the glue that holds the suede to the boot. The talc may be from foot powder, and the amide- containing material may be perspiration. No radioactivity above background is detected.\n2.) Black particulates found in a plastic bag containing the boot are fake suede poly(ester urethane) MBI, obviously from the boot.\n3.) Though not analyzed, I speculate the black substance reported to be on the relative's carpet was also some of the boot material, specifically a poly(ester urethane, MBI.\n4.) It is most unusual that the suede came off of the boot. With the absence of any unusual foreign substances, I can offer two speculations why this occurred. They follow.\n. The witness described a creosol, sulfuric acid, and tar odor during the event. This is an important clue. Creosol contains phenolic-type materials\nT. S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 4\namong other things. So, this may indicate the presence of phenolics, though not necessary from creosol. If the boot was exposed to these materials, there is a very real possibility they caused the adhesive to fail. According to \"The Polymer Handbook\"2 poly(urethanes), of which the suede and glue are composed, are soluble in phenol, m-cresol (a phenolic derivative), formic acid , and sulfuric acid. Phenols sublime easily and would have been gone by the time the boot was received for analysis, and hence not detected. I can rule out sulfuric acid and formic acid because the pH measurements of the boot surface were neutral and possibly skewed to the basic side. These phenolic materials are hazardous and known to cause some of the effects suffered by the witness.3\n. For the second, less likely speculation, I offer that the boot became wet during the encounter. This caused a loss of adhesiveness due to improper bonding of the urethane glue to the fake suede during manufacture. Partially uncured urethane adhesive was found in the boot.\nProcedure:\nSamples: A black suede boot (left) with bare spots was submitted for analysis. There are also black flecks in a plastic bag that contained the boots when the witness shipped them to the investigator. The samples were received by this laboratory on October 21, 2005.\nInfrared spectra were obtained from of the inside and outside of a piece of suede carefully removed from the boot. Spectra were also obtained from scrapings of the \"bare area\", scrapings from the sole and heel, a tarry material found inside the boot (heel), and flecks found in the bag containing the boot. Spectra were acquired on the Analect 360 spectrometer using the Harrick SplitPea® sampling accessory. Additionally, pH measurements were made by placing dampened pHydrion paper on two areas (the suede and the bare regions) of the boot. The samples were also examined with a radiation monitor (SE International's Radiation Alert™ Monitor 4) and a UV light (Optical Engineering's Model 22-UV).\nResults:\nThe results of the individual tests done on the samples follow. These results are summarized in the conclusions section on the page three of this report.\n2 E. H. Immergut et al, \"The Polymer Handbook\", Fourth Edition , John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

S. R. No .: UT044 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 5\nInfrared Analysis: Infrared examination of the outside surface of suede carefully removed from the boot shows it is composed of poly(ester urethane) MBI (MBI = Methylene Bis(phenyl-isocyanate) which is one of the monomeric units of the polymer). Also detected is polydimethylsiloxane. This later material is commonly used as a moisture repellent. The infrared spectrum of the inside of the removed suede only detects poly(ester urethane) MBI. Following are spectra of the outside and inside of the suede, along with a reference of poly(ester urethane) MBI for comparison.\nInfrared Spectra of the Outer and Inner Sides of Removed Boot Suede\n100\n*Boot Suede Area Outer Side (Control) file=Boot1h_\n90\n%\n80\nT\n70\n60\nPf\nP\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - OUTER SIDE\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP\nP - IDENTIFIED AS MOSTLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\nS\nP\nS\nPS\n(MBI = methylene bis(phenyl-isocyanate)\nP\nP\nS - SOME POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE\nBoot Suede Area Inner Side (Control) file=Boot2h\n100\n90\n80\n% T\n70\nSUEDE FROM BOOT - INNER SIDE\nIDENTIFIED AS TOTALLY POLY(ESTER URETHANE) MBI\n60\n50\n3000\n2000\n1500 1000\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n500\nT.

This procedure effectively nulled out the poly(ester urethane) absorption bands. It showed additional absorption due to the siloxane, which matches a reference of polydimethylsiloxane.

    "content": "The following case is used on The Black Vault with permission from the author/investigator. It can not be reproduced in any way without contacting Mr. William Puckett.Radar Analysis and Computation WorksheetHanford, WA sighting of Large Orange ObjectsOctober 18, 2015Prepared by William PuckettUFO Investigator and MeteorologistBackground:2 Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) Officers saw bright orange lights for around 50 seconds between 9:52 and 9:57 PM on Oct 18, 2015. The lights were sighted in a southwesterly direction. The lights were larger than yard lights and were about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.The officers were traveling south on Highway 395 between Connell and Mesa, WA.James Clarkson MUFON Director for Washington State received the sighting report and requested assistance with analysis of radar data. In response to this request I wrote a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requesting aviation radar data for the Pasco, WA (Tri-cities) area.Continue scrolling for more...I received the radar data submission from the FAA about 2 months later (December 18, 2015).  The FAA provided the data that I requested.FIGURE ONE – WITNESS & LOCATIONS OF 2 RADAR SITES.Notes on Radar Data:The radar data were received for Pasco, WA Traffic Control and a NTAP (National Transportation Analysis Program) was also received. The NTAP included a long range radar from Fossil, Oregon which is about 100 miles south of Pasco, WA and the Pasco, WA Traffic Control radar.  (See Figure One to the left).The closest returns on radar were about 18 miles to the southwest (near Pasco, WA airport). (See Figure Two below.)  The interesting thing about the data in Figure Two is that the Pasco radar report listed that returns were “target reports.” This suggests that data were filtered and weather returns, gr0und traffic, birds and radar angels were removed. This suggests that the remaining returns were actual moving aerial targets.  All of the primary returns are shown in Figure Two below.  A typical “unfiltered” radar map is shown in Figure Three below. The radar map in Figure Three is for Albany, New York.  You can see A “conglomerate” of returns and it is difficult to determine real moving targets while Figure Two shows small patterns of returns.We can’t definitively say for sure if the radar picked up the objects seen by the witnesses, but we can say that radar returns were in the direction (southwest) and at the time (9:50 to 10 PM) that the witnesses saw the objects. The radar returns were around 18 miles from the estimated witness location and near the Pasco radar. (See Figure Four below.) Figure Four shows the area of returns and a zoom in showing the speed and direction of movement of the returns.The zoom in box to the left is for returns detected from 9:50 to 9:51 PM. For the box to the left there were six radar returns in sequence.  The target was moving slowly east, then abruptly changes direction to the south-southwest at a higher speed and then turned east-southeast at original speed (38 MPH).  One can’t say for sure if each return represents the same target, but the targets were in sequence with each turn of the radar antenna. The targets were not detected after 9:51 PM.FIGURE TWO – ALL RETURNS 9:30 TO 10 PM – OCT 18, 2015.The zoom in box to the right shows returns from 9:54 to 9:55 PM. The box to the right fits more closely with the witness observation time.  Again the speed of the target is slow (38 to 48 MPH) and moving to the west-southwest. The target then turned direction to the northwest and nearly increased it’s speed tenfold. Again we can’t say for sure if this is one target, but it  fits with the radar antenna rotation sequence. The direction of movement (westerly direction ) fits with what the witnesses saw. The targets were no longer detected after 9:55 PM.Of course the targets could have been multiple targets, but may have showed up as one target on the radar scope if they were close together. The witnesses observed multiple targets.There were also returns noted in the same area observed by the witnesses before the sighting time, but the witnesses would not have been in position to observe the returns.Doppler weather radar data were collected from Portland, Oregon and Spokane, Washington. Both of these radars reach the Pasco, WA area.  Some light showers were observed a few hours prior to the sighting. Skies were clear at Pasco Airport at the time of the sighting. The Doppler radar maps did not show anything unusual. The radar sites did show some scattered showers, but the area was well removed from the sighting area. However, Doppler radars are not designed to detect aircraft. The radars have a narrow beam width (one degree) which means that objects will not be detected unless they happen to fly through the narrow beam.FIGURE THREE – MAP OF ALL PRIMARY RADAR RETURNS ALBANY, NY 9/5/2015.The discussion below makes the assumption that the object(s) seen by the witnesses were detected by radar:One of the officers said that his thumb would cover up the object. A thumb has a width of 2 arc degrees. (The moon has a width of 30 arc minutes which is about 25% the size of a thumb in apparent width.)  Let’s assume that the object had a width of 1 arc degrees:Using trigonometry the width of the object would be around 1,650 feet if what the witnesses saw was detected by radar. For comparison purposes the length of a 747 aircraft is 231 feet with a wingspan of 211 feet.The witnesses thought that the object(s) were at an elevation of 20 to 30 degrees. For computations we will assume that the elevation was 25 degrees. If we assume that the primary radar returns belonged to the object we can say the following:Using trigonometry if the radar returns represented the object, the elevation would have just over 44,000 feet.If the returns represent what the witnesses saw the objects would have been quite large and would have been very visible from the Pasco, WA area.  The fact that the time of the sighting was late (around 10 PM on a Sunday night before the week) and the fact that the objects were only visible for a short time may have resulted in fewer (in any) witnesses.  Also there is a possibility that the objects may have appeared larger to the witnesses due to light scattering in the atmosphere which can make objects appear bigger. This is particularly true if objects are lower on the horizon (25 degrees or lower).FIGURE FOUR – MAP & ZOOM IN OF AREA OF RADAR RETURNS.Conclusion and Summary:2 DOC officers saw 2 large orange objects to the Southwest while returning home from work around 10 PM on October 18, 2015.  The officers were near Connell, WA and were returning to the Tri-Cities area. The officers had never before or have since seen the lights.The lights were near the Hanford Nuclear Facility in Richland, Washington.Aviation radar data were heavily filtered which eliminates most superfluous returns (birds, weather, ground targets, angels, etc.)Radar targets were detected in the direction and times when the witnesses saw the objects. The distance was large (around 18 miles).The radar targets were only visible for 2 periods of time (9:50-9:51 PM & 9:54-9:55 PM) of around one minute. This is consistent with the brief time that the witnesses saw the objects. The radar targets were in a southwesterly direction which is where the witnesses saw the objects.The targets were moving in a westerly direction at speeds of 38 to 48 MPH and then accelerated to over 300 MPH before vanishing from the scope. The radar detected this from 9:54 to 9:55 PM. This is consistent with the direction of movement reported by the witnesses and closest to the time (9:52 to 9:57 PM).If the targets represent what the witnesses saw the objects would have flying around 44,000 feet and would have been over 1,500 feet in width.The witnesses saw multiple targets. Perhaps the targets were so close to one another that the radar only painted one return?The targets were close to Pasco Airport. One would think that others would have witnessed the objects if the radar targets represented what the witnesses saw due to their large size and proximity to the Pasco area.Follow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave",

It can not be reproduced in any way without contacting Mr. William Puckett.Radar Analysis and Computation WorksheetHanford, WA sighting of Large Orange ObjectsOctober 18, 2015Prepared by William PuckettUFO Investigator and MeteorologistBackground:2 Washington State Department of Corrections (DOC) Officers saw bright orange lights for around 50 seconds between 9:52 and 9:57 PM on Oct 18, 2015. The lights were sighted in a southwesterly direction. The lights were larger than yard lights and were about 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon.The officers were traveling south on Highway 395 between Connell and Mesa, WA.James Clarkson MUFON Director for Washington State received the sighting report and requested assistance with analysis of radar data. In response to this request I wrote a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requesting aviation radar data for the Pasco, WA (Tri-cities) area.Continue scrolling for more...I received the radar data submission from the FAA about 2 months later (December 18, 2015).  The FAA provided the data that I requested.FIGURE ONE – WITNESS & LOCATIONS OF 2 RADAR SITES.Notes on Radar Data:The radar data were received for Pasco, WA Traffic Control and a NTAP (National Transportation Analysis Program) was also received. The NTAP included a long range radar from Fossil, Oregon which is about 100 miles south of Pasco, WA and the Pasco, WA Traffic Control radar.  (See Figure One to the left).The closest returns on radar were about 18 miles to the southwest (near Pasco, WA airport). (See Figure Two below.)  The interesting thing about the data in Figure Two is that the Pasco radar report listed that returns were “target reports.” This suggests that data were filtered and weather returns, gr0und traffic, birds and radar angels were removed. This suggests that the remaining returns were actual moving aerial targets.  All of the primary returns are shown in Figure Two below.  A typical “unfiltered” radar map is shown in Figure Three below. The radar map in Figure Three is for Albany, New York.  You can see A “conglomerate” of returns and it is difficult to determine real moving targets while Figure Two shows small patterns of returns.We can’t definitively say for sure if the radar picked up the objects seen by the witnesses, but we can say that radar returns were in the direction (southwest) and at the time (9:50 to 10 PM) that the witnesses saw the objects. The radar returns were around 18 miles from the estimated witness location and near the Pasco radar. (See Figure Four below.) Figure Four shows the area of returns and a zoom in showing the speed and direction of movement of the returns.The zoom in box to the left is for returns detected from 9:50 to 9:51 PM. For the box to the left there were six radar returns in sequence.  The target was moving slowly east, then abruptly changes direction to the south-southwest at a higher speed and then turned east-southeast at original speed (38 MPH).  One can’t say for sure if each return represents the same target, but the targets were in sequence with each turn of the radar antenna. The targets were not detected after 9:51 PM.FIGURE TWO – ALL RETURNS 9:30 TO 10 PM – OCT 18, 2015.The zoom in box to the right shows returns from 9:54 to 9:55 PM. The box to the right fits more closely with the witness observation time.  Again the speed of the target is slow (38 to 48 MPH) and moving to the west-southwest. The target then turned direction to the northwest and nearly increased it’s speed tenfold. Again we can’t say for sure if this is one target, but it  fits with the radar antenna rotation sequence. The direction of movement (westerly direction ) fits with what the witnesses saw. The targets were no longer detected after 9:55 PM.Of course the targets could have been multiple targets, but may have showed up as one target on the radar scope if they were close together. The witnesses observed multiple targets.There were also returns noted in the same area observed by the witnesses before the sighting time, but the witnesses would not have been in position to observe the returns.Doppler weather radar data were collected from Portland, Oregon and Spokane, Washington. Both of these radars reach the Pasco, WA area.  Some light showers were observed a few hours prior to the sighting. Skies were clear at Pasco Airport at the time of the sighting. The Doppler radar maps did not show anything unusual. The radar sites did show some scattered showers, but the area was well removed from the sighting area. However, Doppler radars are not designed to detect aircraft. The radars have a narrow beam width (one degree) which means that objects will not be detected unless they happen to fly through the narrow beam.FIGURE THREE – MAP OF ALL PRIMARY RADAR RETURNS ALBANY, NY 9/5/2015.The discussion below makes the assumption that the object(s) seen by the witnesses were detected by radar:One of the officers said that his thumb would cover up the object. A thumb has a width of 2 arc degrees. (The moon has a width of 30 arc minutes which is about 25% the size of a thumb in apparent width.)  Let’s assume that the object had a width of 1 arc degrees:Using trigonometry the width of the object would be around 1,650 feet if what the witnesses saw was detected by radar. For comparison purposes the length of a 747 aircraft is 231 feet with a wingspan of 211 feet.The witnesses thought that the object(s) were at an elevation of 20 to 30 degrees. For computations we will assume that the elevation was 25 degrees. If we assume that the primary radar returns belonged to the object we can say the following:Using trigonometry if the radar returns represented the object, the elevation would have just over 44,000 feet.If the returns represent what the witnesses saw the objects would have been quite large and would have been very visible from the Pasco, WA area.  The fact that the time of the sighting was late (around 10 PM on a Sunday night before the week) and the fact that the objects were only visible for a short time may have resulted in fewer (in any) witnesses.  Also there is a possibility that the objects may have appeared larger to the witnesses due to light scattering in the atmosphere which can make objects appear bigger. This is particularly true if objects are lower on the horizon (25 degrees or lower).FIGURE FOUR – MAP & ZOOM IN OF AREA OF RADAR RETURNS.Conclusion and Summary:2 DOC officers saw 2 large orange objects to the Southwest while returning home from work around 10 PM on October 18, 2015.  The officers were near Connell, WA and were returning to the Tri-Cities area.

It was visible indifferent places all over Germany. In Austria, it is affirmed a sound of cracking or crushing came from it, as iffrom a thunderbolt, which, however, I take to be groundless.’ Johannes Kepler.Continue scrolling for more...March 21st, 1676: The Italian, Geminiano Montanari, was knowledgeable in geophysics, biology,mathematics, ballistics, and meteorology; but his greatest achievements are considered to have been inastronomy. He reported this sighting to Edmund Halley, who commented – ‘I find it one of the hardest thingsto account for, that I have ever yet met.’….. ‘It appeared one and three quarter hours after sunset, comingover the Adriatic from Dalmatia. It crossed over all Italy, at a height of some 40 miles, and hissed as it passed,over Ronzare. It passed over the sea from Leghorn to Corsica, with a sound like the rattling of a great cartover stones. I compute that it travelled 160 miles a minute. It seemed to be a vast body apparently biggerthan the moon!’ (FSOM/DSB)May 1677: ‘..the famous astronomer, Edmund Halley, Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford University,reported seeing a “great light in the sky all over Southern England, many miles high.”‘July 31st, 1708: ‘..from 9 to 10 p.m., a similar apparition, thought to be 50 miles high, passed overSheerness, and the ‘Buoy at the Nore,’ Suffolk, and London. It moved “with incredible speed, and was verybright. It seemed to vanish and left a pale white light behind it. There were no hissing sounds and noexplosion.”‘ (FSOM)1715: Unusual phenomena were observed on the Moon, at the time of the solar eclipse, by Edmund Halleyand J.E.de Louville – ‘..as it were a sort of flash or momentary vibrations of beams of light, as thoughsomeone were setting fire to gunpowder trails as used in mining. These bright flashes were very brief induration and appeared now here, now there, but always in the shade.’ (FSR 41-2)March 6th, 1716: Halley saw an object illuminating the sky for more than two hours from about 7:00 p.m.onwards: ‘A man could easily read print in the light thrown out by these spears from the same body. It did notchange for two hours, and then it seemed as if new fuel had been cast on a fire.’ / Similar phenomena werereported to Halley by other astronomers of his time, notably by astronomers Gottfried Kirch and Schlazius, atLeipzig, Germany re. an event on July 9th, 1686 and by Montanari an Italian mathematician and astronomerregarding a sighting on March 21st, 1676.March 17th, 1735: ‘A strange apparition of “an uncommon bright glade of light” was seen from the top of hishouse in Buckingham Street, off the Strand, London, by John Bevis, at 8.05 pm, on March 17, 1735, when hewas observing Mars, in the west: “It was quite unlike the Aurora Borealis, being steady and not tremulous inmotion. The stars could be seen through it. It was not a comet; for I could see no nucleus through my 17-footoptical glass. It gre dim in the middle in half an hour, and then seemed to split into two very luminous parts,which grew dimmer till about 9.” (FSOM)August 9th, 1762: Two Swiss astronomers saw an object in front of the sun. They were De Rostan in Basleand Croste in Sole. [Article in 18th Century Sightings]May 1764: Astronomer Hoffman saw a large round spot traverse the sun from north to south. (MHervey)June 17th, 1777: Charles Messier, famous for his nebula catalogue observed a large number of dark spots inthe skies, disc shaped, which were unknown to him. In his log book he wrote – ‘They were large and swift andthey were ships, yet like bells.’August 18th, 1783: Tiberius Cavallo, Italian chemist, inventor and writer on natural philosophy – a fellow ofthe Royal Society, saw at Windsor Castle what he termed a ‘most extraordinary meteor…North-east of theTerrace, in clear sky and warm weather, I saw appear suddenly an oblong cloud nearly parallel to the horizon.Below the cloud was seen a luminous body… It soon became a roundish body, brightly lit up and almoststationary. It was about 9.25 p.m. This strange ball at first appeared bluish and faint, but its light increased,2A List Of Sightings By Astronomersand it soon began to move. At first, it ascended above the horizon, obliquely towards the east. Then itchanged its direction and moved parallel to the horizon. It vanished in the SE. I saw it for half a minute, andthe light it gave out was prodigious. It lit up every object on the face of the country. It changed shape tooblong, acquired a tail, and seemed to split up into two bodies of small size. About two minutes later came arumble like an explosion.’ [Article in 18th Century Sightings]. Cavallo’s book ‘The History and Practice ofAerostation’ was published, in London, two year later. He was buried in 1809 in St.Pancras Churchyard.(FSOM)Also on August 30th an object was observed at Greenwich Observatory from which eight objects emerged,described as satellites. / Other reports by scientists named by Wilkins on the following dates: March 19, 1718at Oxford, December 5th, 1737 and December 16th, 1742 – both in London.William Herschel on Mars – ‘..From other phenomena it appears, however, that this planet is not without aconsiderable atmosphere; for, besides the permanent spots on its surface, I have often noticed occasionalchanges of partial bright belts.. and also a darkish one, in a pretty high latitude.. And these alterations we canhardly ascribe to any other cause than the variable disposition of clouds and vapours floating in theatmosphere of that planet.[Result of the contents of this paper] …And that planet has a considerable but moderate atmosphere, so thatits inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours.Datchet, Dec.1, 1783. W.HERSCHEL’ [On the remarkable Appearances at the Polar Regions of the PlanetMars, the Inclination of its Axis, the Position of its Poles, and its Spheroidal Figure; with a few Hints relating toits real Diameter and Atmosphere. By William Herschel, Esq. F.R.S.]October 22nd, 1790: ‘The famous astronomer, Frederick William Herschel, who discovered the planetUranus and its satellites and the satellites of Saturn, was looking through a 20-foot reflector telescope.. whenhe saw, in time of total eclipse of the moon, many bright and luminous points, small and round. But “thebrightness of the moon, notwithstanding the fact that it was in eclipse”, did not permit him to view thephenomenon long enough to locate these points on the lunar surface. / He wrote to the Royal Society – “Weknow too little of the surface of the moon to venture a surmise of the cause and remarkable colour of thesepoints.”‘ [Article in 18th Century Sightings]. Previous sightings of lights on or near the moon were made byHerschel in 1783 and 1787. (FSOM)May 1799: A luminous spot was seen moving across the disc of Mercury by Johann Schroeter, his assistantK.L.Harding at Lilienthal observatory , and other observers- ‘In the transit of 1799.. Schroter and Harding atLilienthal, and Kohler at Dresden, saw a small luminous spot on the dark disk. The spot was not stationary,for Harding saw it change its position, and later in the day Schroter saw it sometimes on one part of the disk,sometimes on another. Others saw, not one, but two small spots of a greyish colour.’ (Monthly Notices 38,1878/MU)February 7th, 1802: An unknown body [‘dark disc’ DL]was seen crossing the sun by the Astronomer Fritsch,at Magdeburg, in central Germany. (NL)October 10th 1802: An unknown dark body was seen by Herr Fritsch rapidly crossing the sun. (NL)January 16th 1818: A Mr.Capel Lofft, astronomer of Ipswich, England, observed a strange object near thesun. It was visible for three hours and a half. (DL/NL)June 26th, 1819: Three dark bodies crossed the sun together, observed by astronomer Franz Gruithuisen.(NL) Pastorff saw something near the sun, which he had thought was a comet; but could not have been,according to Olbers. (NL)September 7th, 1820: Francis Arago, the famous French Physicist/Astronomer describes observations thatday during the eclipse, at Embrun, of objects moving across the sky in a nearly military precision. Hementions also that a number of other scientists have seen similar events.3A List Of Sightings By AstronomersFebruary, 1821: A bright point of light, like a star, was seen on the Moon, in the crater Aristarchus – on the 4th& 7th of February, by Capt.Kater; on the 5th, by Dr.Olbers. Star-like lights on the moon also observed thatyear in May and November. (NL)October 23rd 1822: Astronomer Pastorff observes two unknown objects cross the sun’s disc. (DL)May 22nd 1823: Astronomer named Webb sees bright shining thing near Venus. (DL)October 18th, 1824: ‘At five o’clock, morning.. a light was seen upon the dark part of the moon, byGruithuisen. It disappeared. Six minutes later it appeared again, disappeared again, and then flashedintermittently, from 5:30 A.M., until sunrise ended the observations.’ (NL)January 22nd, 1825: A star-like light was again observed in Aristarchus, on the Moon; reported byRev.J.B.Emmett. (NL)February 13th, 1826: Gruithuisen reported that on this date, two straight lines of light, with, between them adark band that was covered with luminous points, was observed in the western crater of Messier.(NL)July 31st 1826: Unknown object seen by astronomers. (DL)May 26th 1828: Disc crossing the sun, seen through telescope. (DL)September 6th to November 1st, 1831: At Geneva Observatory the Swiss astronomer Dr.Wartmann and hisstaff saw a strange luminous body practically every night. / In the years following there were reports byPastorff (1834, 1836, 1837), Cacciatore (1835), De Vico (1837), De Cuppis (1837), and Glaisher (1844).July 4th, 1832: W.L.Webb saw ‘a brilliant display of minute dots and streaks of light, in the Mare Crisium..’ onthe Moon. (NL)December 22nd, 1835: Another star-like light in the crater Aristarchus – reported by Francis Bailey. (NL)May 15th, 1836: At Havana, Professor Auber saw many luminous bodies that seemed to move out from thesun, in diverse directions. (BoD)1844: James Glaisher reported shining discs “which sent out quickly flickering waves of light.” (UFOsTSH)May 11th-13th, 1845: ‘Erman sends me a report of Capocci about bodies, which he has seen pass in front ofthe sun on 11 to 13 May… he has also seen bodies of indeterminate shape like shadows pass, and for thisreason the idea occurred to him that there could be nearer bodies and therefore that one must pull out theeyepiece further in order to see them clearly. In fact, when he pulled out the eyepiece 1 to 2 centimeters, hesaw these bodies pass by with a very definite outline. They had irregular shapes. A few went quickly likeshooting stars, others remained visible 2 to 3 seconds and so on.’ (Letter from astronomer HeinrichSchumacher to mathematician Carl Gauss, Sept.18 1845)… …G.A.Erman (1806-1877) worked chiefly interrestrial magnetism and related fields, and also undertook many expeditions. His father-in-law was Bessel…Ernesto Capocci (de Belmonte) (1798-1864) was the first astronomer at the Capidomente observatory inNaples, remaining there until 1848. (I.Grattan-Guinness, FSR 23-2)‘Italian astronomer working at Capodimonte Observatory, Naples saw a number of shining discs, some star-shaped, others sporting a tail-like appendage. He considered them of smallish size. / Further reports in thefollowing years came from Schmidt (1847), Brown and Sidebotham (1849) and Inglis in Switzerland in thesame year.’March 18th & 19th, 1847: Large luminous spots seen upon the dark side of the moon, and a general glowupon the upper limb, by Rev.T.Rankin and Prof.Chevaillier. (NL)4A List Of Sightings By AstronomersSummer 1847: Benjamin Scott and his five-year-old son both observed, through a telescope, a body thatseemed to be the size of Venus crossing the sun. (BoD)December 11th & 12th, 1847: A bright light that flashed intermittently, was seen on the dark side of themoon, by Hodgson. (NL)September 11th, 1852: A bright shining disc was visible to people in Staffordshire between 4.15 and 4.45p.m. Lord Wrottesley, who had an observatory at Wolverhampton, said it seemed relatively near the Moon.Others said near Venus.

A bolide traversed the sky in a west to south direction between Ophiuchus and theScorpion. At the altitude of Ed Ophiuchus, the meteor split in two, and formed two glowing nucleii about 1deg. distant from each other, and connected by a luminous trail. In that manner, the two bolides followed thesame trajectory and lost themselves in the misty horizon.

Island of Jersey, September 1895.’ (L’Astr. v9)December 1895: Muller, of Nymegen, Holland saw a luminous object near Venus.July 31st, 1896: At Smith Observatory, U.S.A., astronomers noticed a dark circular disc-shaped object goingacross the moon’s surface very quickly, timed at about four seconds, which should prove its closeness toEarth. / Coming back to the moon and various observations of lights, etc., in England in the Seventies or so ofthe 19th century, an astronomer, Birt, deposited at the Royal Astronomical Society over 1500 observations oflights, moving objects and changes of brightness, mostly in the crater Plato, which is, with its about 60 milesdiameter quite a prominent feature of the moon.September 20th/21st, 1896: Echo Mountain, California, USA; evening. Dr.L.Swift observed a ‘luminousobject’ about one degree above the sun – ‘..Going out on the veranda, the object was seen more distinctly. Atfirst it occurred to me that it might be a small fire on the mountain, but this idea was quickly dispelled, as one-half of the sun’s disk was still above the mountain, and the object still higher. Seizing an opera glass I sawthat it had a very much fainter companion some 30′ north, but it could not be seen without the glass. In aboutfour minutes after the sun had set the two objects also disappeared behind the mountain. / Both objects wereseen by some fifteen people… Last evening I began a search with the comet-seeker with the sun 10[degreesign] in altitude, but nothing was seen until fully one half of the sun had disappeared when I caught sight of it,but its faintness surprised me, for it was less bright through the telescope than with the naked eye theprevious evening… / I only saw it for 5 seconds… I estimate that the object disappeared simultaneously withthe sun’s upper limb. / The only thing that perplexes me about this strange affair is, that the sun, object, andcompanion, were not in line, but must have deviated from it by 30 [degrees]or more.’ (The AstronomicalJournal XVII)January 3rd, 1898: At 8.40pm, a Monsieur Georget observed something unusual in the sky while returninghome – ‘..I saw in the northeast, at an elevation of 30-40 degrees, a luminous meteor, fairly bright, having thethe same colour as the planet Mars, travelling at a relatively slow rate through the sky. It went away toward9A List Of Sightings By Astronomersthe north and disappeared at the horizon at a point that formed an alignment with the satrs Zeta and EtaUrsae Majris, behind the hills situated to the north of Vannes, about eight or ten kilometres away, and about110 metres higher than the town itself. / It went through a trajectory of 45 degrees in five or six minutes,during which time it steadily lost brightness, as a luminous body would if it went away. About the time of itsdisappearance, one could see a yellow or reddish flash. / I was able to examine this meteor for a few minuteswith a small telescope of 30 mm.. It seemed to be formed by two luminous bodies, A and B, situated atapproximately the same elevation, the brighter one, A, being in front. Remarkable peculiarity: the motion of Bwas affected by sudden oscillations, which lasted about half a second. Four or five oscillations were countedper minute. These objects gave the appearance of two balloons linked together.’ When published in theperiodical Comptes Rendus, this sighting was compared to a sighting by Schmidt, on October 19th, 1863.(CTSc)April 25th, 1898: Prof. J.Michailovitch of Belgrade Observatory saw for about six minutes an object hoveringover Belgrade. He referred to it as a ‘comet,’ but it obviously did not behave like one.June 29th, 1898: A French astronomer, Lucien Libert, who was in the habit of observing and recordingmeteors at every possible opportunity, saw – ‘..at 1hr. 03m.A.M., a bolide with very slow motion (that) glided insixty seconds from Hercules to Ursa Major. Its diameter was 25 seconds of arc, and it was very bright andwhite in colour.’ (CTSc)July 4th, 1898: Lucien Libert – ‘..I was in my observatory when suddenly, at 7hrs. 10m. 18s., I saw a luminousbody appear above a tree at the northern horizon. It was of a beautiful golden-yellow colour and perfectlyspherical. Its apparent diameter was one-fourth that of the moon. This object started from the north-northeast,rose slowly in the sky, went through the zenith, then started losing brightness as it went down toward thehorizon. It disappeared at elevation 30 degrees above the above the west-southwest horizon, near Venus, at7hrs. 22m. 44s. Its duration, therefore, was twelve minutes, twenty-six seconds. It is by far the longestduration I have observed. A short time before it disappeared it increased its speed… A fairly strong noise ofexplosion was heard a few seconds after its disappearance.’ (CTSc)May 6th, 1899: Monsieur Libert, again – ‘..at 8:30 P.M., a magnificent bolide with a very, very slow motion, ofyellow colour and surrounded with a shower of sparks, appeared in the constellation of the Scale. Night hadnot completely come and it was difficult to ascertain points of comparison. Only Jupiter and Spica werevisible. This bolide had a completely peculiar shape, which I cannot compare to anything better than atadpole’s head. There was a very bright point in front, and a tail with extremely fast movements of undulation.’(CTSc)June 7th, 1899: M.Libert – ‘..at 9 hrs. 25m. 32s. P.M., a yellow bolide, very slow, of the magnitude of Venus,leaving no trail, went from Ophiuchus to Scorpio in twelve seconds. (CTSc)February 9th, 1902: M.Libert – ‘..at 7 hrs. 40m. P.M., I observed with MM.Schoux, Marcel Libert and LucienBriand an extremely remarkable bolide, of the magnitude of Venus. It started from the position of Capella, at apoint I estimate to be about five hours of right ascension and +45 degrees declination, and went on a straightline toward beta Persei, which it reached in about three seconds. Having reached the vicinity of this star, itsuddenly changed direction, followed a sort of loop and went toward Aldebaran with a curved trajectory.When it was about to disappear it split into three or four objects of approximately second magnitude. Thewhole observation had lasted about twelve seconds. the point of disappearance was about 4 hrs. 50m. ofright ascension and +20 degrees of declination. The bolide left a trail that lasted about one and one-halfminutes.’ (CTSc)November 20th 1902: ‘ (At) 9.27 a.m., Mr.Griffiths, the assistant astronomer at Adelaide Observatory andcolleague were taking weather observations when a “brilliant globular light” appeared to the SSE at about 45degrees elevation. It moved slowly north and remained visible until 9.31 a.m., covering about 20 degrees ofarc in that time, and was lost sight of about 45 degrees above the northern horizon. When it was nearoverhead it appeared elongated “and took an elliptical form” with its axis in the direction of motion.

It passed over thestar y of the Eagle with great speed. Its breadth was around 15′ and it disappeared, leaving behind it a lighttrail that faded immediately. Nevertheless, the star remained invisible at least three and a half seconds afterthe meteor’s disappearance, as if the light had been absorbed by the substance that this had abandoned inspace. Dr MAX WOLF Director of the Observatory of Heidelberg.’ (L’Astr. v25)January 27th-28th, 1912: Astronomer Frank B.Harris wrote to Popular Astronomy and The Times that hesaw “a huge object of some kind, moving across the moon’s surface.” He stated that the object was opaque,black, approximately 250 miles long and 50 miles wide, and close enough to the surface to cast a shadow onthe moon.

He saw a luminous unknown object sort ofoscillating beneath the clouds. Its brightness was stronger than the planet Jupiter and its shape regular andelliptical. The nature of this object was unknown to the astronomer.Info from Life 5/5/52 article: ‘The object “..exhibited a sort of wobbling motion” and then disappeared behindsome clouds. It reappeared and “projected against the dark clouds gave the strongest impression of self-luminosity.” The object then moved slowly from south to north and two and a half minutes behind acloudbank. / According to the astronomer’s calculations, confirmed by his wife, who with their two daughterswas with him, the object was 235 feet long and 100 feet thick. Its horizontal speed ranged between 120 and180 miles per hour and its vertical rise between 600 and 900 miles per hour.’ (JGuieu)June or July 1947: Jyvaskyla, Finland – ‘A technician who was also an amateur astronomer was reading abook after midnight and saw a metallic cigar-shaped object flying at a distance of about two kilometers fromnorthwest to southeast.

He reported – ‘In all of my severalthousand hours of night sky-watching, I have never seen anything so strange as this. I was so astonished thatmy impression of it was somewhat confused. How I wished I could have had some binoculars at hand. Nosound whatever.’ (Michel)Letter from Clyde Tombaugh to Richard Hall, dated September 10th 1957: ‘Dear Mr.Hall: Regarding thesolidity of the phenomenon I saw: My wife thought she saw a faint connecting glow across the structure. Theilluminated rectangles I saw did maintain an exact fixed position with respect to each other, which would tendto support the impression of solidity. I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, becausesome similarity to it should have appeared many times. I do a great deal of observing (with telescopic andunaided eye) in the backyard and nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since.’ (AId/TUE)1949: Witness Bertrand Collin, New Zealand – ‘My second sighting..

It remainedstationary for some time and pulsed with a regular steady beat of light, but now a dull red colour instead oforange it had whilst travelling along. / In its stationary position the dull red colour was almost hard to see; theUFO was still stationary but after about twenty minutes in this position it became brighter. It went from dull redto bright red, and then to bright orange. At a terrific speed it went from 10 degrees north to a position slightlynorth from my east viewpoint. It slowed down from bright orange to its usual red to its pulsating dull red whilststationary again. It remained in this stationary position for about fifteen to twenty minutes. / From this position12A List Of Sightings By Astronomersit went due south, to a position SSE and a bright orange whilst in motion, where it again became stationaryand a dull red colour.

This time its movements andappearance were carefully checked by a scientist. E.Nuncio, professor of astronomy in the technical school ofDurango, studied the saucer through a telescope and other instruments. Afterwards he gave his data to thepress. Nuncio said that the saucer maintained 40,000 feet altitude. It was shaped somewhat like a child’s top,and had fracture bands around it where its material was joined together. The tip or point of the top was red,and was tilted down and toward the east. Its altitude over the horizon was 53 degrees 20 minutes and itsposition was southeast.

The rays or beams of light could be seen distinctly from the dome and attached directlybeneath it was a much larger and flattened dome with a protruding band running in a circumference aroundits edge. This was clearly seen in the telescope by the rays of light thrown out from the apertures in the topdome. The underneath of the large flattened bottom dome was hollow and appeared to be glowing red, butthere were no vapour trails or gases to be seen. / It did not rotate but kept the same portion of the dometowards the telescope until it changed its angular course.

Frank Halstead ofDarling Observatory was travelling on a fast train to California with his wife Ann, when she called his attentionto an object moving parallel to the train, and at about the same speed, above a range of mountains. Thisapparent pacing lasted for four or five minutes. The appearance of the object was described to FrankEdwards during a 1959 interview – ‘..At the time I thought it was a blimp, you know, one of those cigar-shapeddirigibles.. But as I watched it I realised that it could not be a blimp – they are only about two hundred feetlong – and this thing was gigantic. It was about eight hundred feet long. I could estimate that because it wasso close to the mountain ridges where trees and clumps of trees were visible for comparison..’While Frank and Ann Halstead were watching this object, a second object suddenly appeared behind it – ‘..Itwas a disc-shaped thing. In fact, both the objects were very shiny, we noticed.. (possibly) about one hundredfeet in diameter – flat on the bottom with a low dome on the top side..

Warner continues, “The frequency of the pulsating wasapproximately 11/2 flashes per second and between maximum brilliance the source could be seen as a pointof light slightly more intense than the surrounding walls. There were definite indications of reflection from thewest wall and the floor was faintly lit by the glare.” Warner then goes into some detail in trying to explain theflashing light but he himself regards the occurrence as an unsolved mystery..’ (Uranus, 7/8-58)April 21st, 1956: Luanda, Angola – ‘Astronomer C.M.Bettencourt, observing the moon through a smalltelescope, saw 8 luminous objects enter the eyepiece from the left proceeding from the left towards themoon’s position in the sky.

Suddenly, it split into two seperate forms which moved off in opposite directions, and he could onlytrack one of these for a time until it went out of sight.(Awareness, Autumn 1978)‘A 1977 poll of American astronomers (conducted by Peter Sturrock), published in JSE, showed the following.Out of 2611 questionnaires 1356 were returned. In response to whether the UFO problem deserved furtherstudy the replies were: 23% certainly, 30% probably, 27% possibly, 17% probably not, 3% certainly not.Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the amount of reading done on the subject and theopinion that further study was in order.’ ‘UFO’s and Mainstream Science’ by Bernhard Harsch, Ph.D Five percent of the respondents had experienced sightings that they could not explain.April 16th, 1979: At 1 a.m., Amateur astronomer Dave Darling sighted a large cigar-shaped object close tothe crater Isidorus, near the Sea of Nectar, while observing the moon with a 121/2 inch reflector. The object41A List Of Sightings By Astronomerswas ‘..about ten miles in length, and 11/2 miles in diameter.. silvery metallic, casting a distinct shadow ontothe lunar surface..

Later, the object disappeared…’ (FredSt)A statistical analysis of UFO observations produced by the Institute of Space Research of the Academy ofSciences, USSR was published in 1979. The report stated that 7.5% of UFO witnesses are astronomers.December 30th, 1979: Kunmin, China; 7.40am. A sighting by astronomers attending an astronomicalcongress was reported by Zhang Zhousheng – ‘..the weather was magnificent. Many comrades and I wereobserving the clear sky from the Yunnan Observatory. Suddenly, the astronomers discovered at 20 degreesbelow the zenith a strange object flying from west to east. It’s velocity was similar to that of an aircraft at highaltitude. We could not distinguish the shape of its nose since the object was too high in the sky. What caughtour attention was that on its back there could be seen flowing three flames of physical particles, very brilliant,with an orange-yellow colour. From a distance, this object seemed like an electric arc. At a moment when thesun had not yet risen, an object of such luminosity emerging from the deep blue sky offered a spectacle trulymagnificent.’ (A.Huneeus, UFO Universe, Summer ’89)April 13th, 1980: Munich, Germany; 10.55pm. Engineer and amateur astronomer, Mauro Venturini observed‘Eight light yellow-coloured discs with fuzzy-looking peripheries (which) appeared at the level of theconstellation Bootes and flew slowly.. from.. northeast.. to southwest…’ Commented Mr.Venturini – “Since theUFOs were flying in such a peculiar formation, the confusion with something else is ruled out.. before I sawthis I never believed in UFOs but I honestly say that I have changed from Saul to Paul and am now convincedof their existence..” (UFOsTSH)June 9th, 1981: Tao-yvan, Taiwan – ‘..Mr.Tsai Chang-hsien, Director of Taipei Yuan-shan AstronomicalObservatory, said he noticed (the) array of 15 light spots yesterday when he was driving along Taipei Bridge,and he hurried back to the Observatory at once to study the singular astronomical phenomenon. / He saiddue to the regular rotation of the universe, there should only be two planets, Venus and Mercury, in thewestern sky of Taiwan at this time of the year. Unfortunately, as the elevation angle those 15 light spotsformed was too low, the telescope of the Observatory could not reach them. / In spite of his consultation withother observatories and the information that several citizens supplied over the phone, till 12:00 a.m. last night,Director Tsai was still unable to provide an answer. / However, as he pointed out, the so-called unidentifiedflying objects were not necessarily flying saucers, but only mystery beyond our current knowledge..’ (UOMCh)June 15th, 1981: Taipei, Taiwan; Afternoon – ‘Fifteen light spots again appeared over taipei. They were seenpositioned in a straight line at equal intervals of separation. They were sighted also by Cai Zhangxian,director of the Taiwan Observatory in North Taiwan. / A similar array of UFOs was spotted by YunanObservatory at about the same time.’ (UOMCh)late-October 1981: Bradford area, UK – ‘Amateur astronomer David Roberts, a former sceptic, revised hisopinions on seeing two fireballs that drifted together across the moors. He remarked to the press, “I amconvinced that professional astronomers should come to observe the strange things that are now happeningat Woodside. I believe that young and older people on the estate could get worried if scientific observationsare not carried out and an answer found soon.” ‘ (PUFOM)early-1980s/1970s: Presquile and The Sandbanks Provincial Parks, Lake Ontario, Canada. ‘..Throughout theyears, on clear starry summer nights, being amateur astronomers, we would stare up while sitting around thecampfire. We would see aircraft lights, satellites and the occasional meteorite fly by. On a number ofevenings, we would witness what at first appeared to be the familiar white light of a satellite. The only thingthat would set it apart would be its ability to stop dead and change direction (90-180 degree turns), with nochange in speed (which was already faster than a conventional aircraft). Sometimes, we would see aformation of lights doing this and on one occasion, that I can recall, we were looking at what appeared to be42A List Of Sightings By Astronomersthe Pleiades Cluster, but then split apart into seven separate lights that flew off in two different directions…’(S.R.Liddle, UFOUn, Winter ’95)1982: Chinasaki, Japan. While riding a train, amateur astronomer Yasumo Mizushima, and many otherpeople, sighted a cylindrical “..bright orange object very bright in the sky.”(A.Huneeus, UFO Universe, Spring ’93)1983: Japan. Yasumo Mizushima reported that, while looking through his telecope, he saw “many objectspass across the southeastern part of the Moon. Five objects shaped like a small piece of ‘rice’ crossed thelunar surface..,” and that “..other people back then caught this object at the same time in other places.”Mr.Mizushima estimated that the objects had a diameter of about 400-500 metres. In the years to come, hewas to observe these objects cross the moon a further seven times.

Yasumo Mizushima filmed an anomalous object near the moon. (UFOsTSH)October 1985: Japan; 12.30am. Yasumo Mizushima had been filming the moon, with his video cameraconnected to two Celestron telescopes (C-14 and C-8), when he noticed and filmed two unidentified objects‘manoeuvring around the southeast side of the moon’s surface. Their shadows on the moon were clearlydiscernable, which excluded the possibility of their being somewhere “out in space” between the Earth andthe moon. They flew close above the sea of craters..’ Later, Mr.Mizushima estimated the objects to be 1,200-1,500 feet in length. (UFOsTSH)Summer 1987: Trenton-Lake Ontario, Canada. ‘..I was sititng at a park in the vening with my fiance.. Welooked up and saw a formation of lights travelling completely silently from the direction of CFB Trentontowards, yet again, the Lake. The following week, there were reports of similar formations causing problemsfor the local airbase. They were witnessed hovering at a high altitude over the airbase on different occasions,always causing the searchlights to come on and aircraft to be scrambled…’ (S.R.Liddle, UFOUn, Winter ’95)May 1989: Yokohama, Japan. Akira Ishiguro photographed three black oval objects over the surface of thesun. They changed position from one shot to the next. (UFOsTSH)April 1991: Yokohama, Japan. Akira Ishiguro while making test photographs of the sun using a Polaroidcamera attached to a telescope with a 60mm diameter lens and a 660mm focal lens, obtained a single shotof an unidentified object that has been described as ‘..something like a huge space station.. above the disc ofthe sun, a space platform on which apparently 5 cigar-shaped objects had docked…’ (UFOsTSH +A.Huneeus, UFO Universe, Spring ’93)September 8th, 1991: About 40 miles east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA; approx.2pm. ‘..an astronomerwho was a passenger on board a commercial aircraft reported seeing three disc-shaped objects moving attremendous speed and flying in a spread-out triangular formation..’ (Stan Gordon)March 15th, 1992: Moscow astronomer E.V.Arsyukhin saw something extraordinary on the Moon – ‘At 1645hrs, and lasting for 21/2 seconds, I observed the rapid flight, over a zig-zag course, of a square black body.This body appeared literally “out of nowhere”. It flew at first towards the east, and then towards the west, andthen it vanished in the bowels of the Crater Alphons. The length of its flight was about 500 kms, and its speedwas in the neighbourhood of 200 kms per second. The length of the body was about 5 kms. Its speed wasuniform. I am totally confident of this. The quality of the viewing at the time was excellent.’ (A.Arkhipov, FSR41-2[trans:G.Creighton])43A List Of Sightings By AstronomersOctober 7th, 1992: Kharkov, Russia. Yu A.Lutsenko saw something mysterious on the Moon – ‘At 23.14 and40 seconds, against the background of the Sea of Rain, I saw an extremely bright patch, with an assymetricaloutline, which was moving. It was seen slightly to the south of Plato and it travelled almost along themeridian… for 41/2 minutes. When it vanished, it was not instantaneous, but lasted some 2-3 seconds, dyingout as it were.’ (A.Arkhipov, FSR 41-2[trans:G.Creighton])March 31st, 1993: 1) Truro, Cornwall, UK; 1.09am. Phillip Young, “astronomer for some years,” observed, for30-40 seconds, two very bright objects travel from the area of Ursa Minor, going parallel with the pointers inUrsa Major. They were blue-white and “..left a ropey trail, like a vortex from a plane wing, though.. it was not aplane because it had no navigation lights and was.. silent…”2) Sligo County, Ireland; 1.10am. ‘Seen by Astronomer NW to SE.. two bright orange stars leaving fiery trainbehind them. Other smaller, fainter objects with trails also.’ (Aw 19-2 & 19-3)March 24th, 1994: Ossett, Yorkshire, England; approx.9pm. A father and son, both astronomers, made anobservation through a telescope set up in their garden. ‘There seemed to be hundreds of these lights movingtogether. As I focussed the telescope on them, I suddenly saw that the lights were attached to much largerobjects. There were seven cigar-shaped objects – enormous. Three lines of small yellow/white lightsappeared to be running along the full length of them. At the front was a small red light. This continued for atleast thirty minutes. I have never seen anything like this in my life.’ (UFO 7/8-94)May 11th, 1994: Brooklyn, New York, USA; 10pm. ‘While viewing the full moon through my Tele VueGenesis-sdf refractor telescope, I saw a small, perfectly round, black object pass over the lunar disk. Theobject took approximately 10 to 15 seconds to make the transit. The object was in sharp focus, not fuzzy atall. The moon was also in focus at the time. It appeared as if out of nowhere on the eastern edge of themoon, travelled across the moon’s face from east to west, then disappeared into the black sky at the moon’swestern edge. I looked to see if it was visible with the naked eye after it had passed the moon, but it was not.I do not recall exactly which eyepiece I was using at the time, but I am sure the magnification was somewherein the 30 to 60 power range. I am currently 34, and I have been an amateur astronomer ever since receivingmy first telescope at age 7. I am thoroughly familiar with the night sky, and I have perfect vision.’ (NUFORC)June 15th, 1995: Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA; 7.30pm. ‘..Three disk shaped objects were observed tothe north of the city and moving to the south. Objects were arranged in a triangular formation and appearedblue in color, almost matching the color of the sky. When objects reached the zenith they abruptly veered tothe east and rapidly disappeared from view. When close to this observer, the objects were approx half the fullmoon’s diameter. This observer is an amateur astronomer and has been for past 40 yrs. Prior to myretirement i have been employed as an electro mech design engineer at various firms for over 40 yrs. I havebeen furnished a Q clearance while employed at the Sandia corp during the early ’50’s.’ (NUFORC)December 19th, 1995: Joliet, Illinois, USA; 3.20pm. ‘While driving east on U.S. Highway 30, an observer wellversed in astronomy and weather saw two objects in a clear sky, hovering. One.. appeared to float around theother. They were coloured dull aluminium on top and black on the bottom. Both the tops and bottoms of theobjects were less than perfect circles. (They) were observed for about 8 miles of travel.’ (J.Rath ‘The I-Files’)1995: North Vancouver, Canada. An astronomer told the RCMP that she had seen “a dark arrowhead-shapedobject – three times the size of a jumbo jet – with orange-yellow lights at the tips.” She reportedly told theHerzberg Institute of Astrophysics that there “..was absolutely no sound, and the speed was incredible. Thiswas no aircraft or weather balloon. I found the experience a little disconcerting to say the least.”(Can.Nat.Archives/UFORup, 1-7)February 13th, 1996: Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland. ‘Amateur astronomer Alan White, 17, saw the objectthrough a friend’s telescope.’ (UFO 5/6-96)February 18th, 1996: Brighton, England; 10.40pm – ‘I know that UFOs exist – two orange discs flew over myhouse.. These had the apparent size about two-thirds the diameter of the full Moon, and were travelling atabout 1,000 ft and a speed of 200 miles per hour. They were completely silent. / I’ve spent a lot of timestargazing as an amateur astronomer and have seen some very unusual sights (green meteors etc.), but44A List Of Sightings By Astronomersthese objects were totally different and inexplicable. They were in sight for about 12-15 seconds and I couldestimate their altitude and speed from the height of the mist which was spreading across the sky at the time.However, I have severe doubts about the extraterrestrial hypothesis..’ (Dr.Alan P.Morse, UFO 5/6-97)April 10th, 1996: near Huntsville, Alabama, USA; 8.30pm. A female amateur astronomer and her six-year-olddaughter looking into the sky directly overhead saw “..a fuzzy white light.. like the Comet Hyakutake”descending in an arc toward the horizon, moving very rapidly. It stopped falling just above some trees, andthe woman viewed it for 15 minutes with her telescope. It “..did not decrease in its intensity” as a meteorwould, and was “much larger than a star.” The UFO stopped, travelled horizontally to the left, stopped again,travelled to the right a short distance, stopped once more, then moved straight up and straight down. Finally,it veered leftward and was gone. (UFORup, 1-9)May 5th, 1996: Wayne, New Jersey, USA; 10.12pm. A party of amateur astronomers set up their telescopeon a hillside, hoping to get good views of Venus, then prominent on the western horizon. The first astronomerpeering through the telescope’s eyepiece saw “..a bright flash near Venus.” S/he said, “At first I thought it wassome sort of meteor exploding in the upper atmosphere.” Another member of the group described theexplosion as “A whitish-green colour.”When the first astronomer looked again, s/he could make out a grey saucer shape with “..two bright lights onthe top of the dome. It was about the size of a two-bedroom house.” There were two transparent “glassblisters” fore and aft of the object’s dome. While in view for about 20 seconds, it hovered and then flew awayto the north very fast. (UFORup, 1-13)“I’ve been stargazing since the age of six. I’m now 73 and in all that time I’ve not seen one UFO. Astronomersdon’t generally see UFOs. We leave that sort of thing to housewives and policemen.” “Anyone who believesin UFOs must also believe in Father Christmas.” Patrick Moore, 1996.“UFOs are a figment of the imagination.” Richard Taylor, President Interplanetary Society, 1996.early-November 1996: Bombay, India. ‘..In the Thane-Panvel district of the city, eye-witness Ms. Brooksspotted a glowing “frisbee-like object” seen moving in an arch around 9.00pm.. / “It disappeared in a fewseconds but not before emitting a beam of light. I had my binoculars and telescope which I use for star-gazingfrom my farm, but before I could get to them it vanished. / I am a regular skywatcher and I know what anartificial satellite looks like – something like a zero candle bulb. This was something else – brighter, goldenwithout the blinking, coloured lights you see on aeroplanes. It was something like the planet Saturn seen fromthe side without its rings,” said Ms.Brooks.’ (G.W.Birdsall, UFO 3/4-97)May 22nd, 1997: Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada; 10.30pm. Amateur astronomer Nicholas K. set up hisSchmidt Cassegrain telescope in his backyard. He was looking “to find galaxies in the Big Dipper” when henoticed “a giant white cloud and against it as a background.. a cigar-shaped object about the size of anaeroplane, black or brown in colour.”The UFO was “unlit (and) it had four or five wings at right angles to and along its body. Flew at speed ofplane. No sound.. No idea of height but beneath cloud. It hadn’t rained.. Didn’t see craft through telescope…”(Joe Daniels/UFORup, 2-23)July 31st, 1997: Barrie, Ontario, Canada; 10.10pm. An amateur astronomer observed an unusual meteorwith “a brilliant green trail and a trail of sparks like conventional fireworks…It made a noise as it passedoverhead. Not a whistle, not a whine, a rushing noise and a series of pop, pop, pop noises, like an out of tunecar engine backfiring. As an amateur astronomer, I know meteors are usually silent unless they are bolidesand explode in the atmosphere or on impact. I have seen lots of meteors before, and all were silent.” (UFOTimes 45)October 5th, 1997: Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA; 7pm. An amateur astronomer witness, who spends manyhours observing the sky, noticed a ‘comet’ heading north. It looked like it was moving at the speed of asatellite, with the tail fading to nothing – ‘I know comets don’t move like this.’( NUFORC)45A List Of Sightings By AstronomersDecember 24th, 1997: Kimsar, Rajahstan State, India; 11pm – ‘A Swiss family and a dozen local residentswatched as a UFO performed aerobatic manoeuvres high above the town of Kimsar..

An amateur astronomer doing some backyard observationssighted a UFO. The witness ‘..owns a telescope and is familiar with the planets’ and states that he waswatching some aircraft when he saw a “bright, star-like source of light approx. west-southwest.. in thegenerally clear sky.”After fetching/focussing his telescope, the witness could see “..what appeared to be a solid white globe, butthe centre of it appeared to be more transparent.” It didn’t move, but there was another smaller sphere justabove it “..making a continuous back-and-forth motion, in a somewhat circular fashion..

During the Leonid Meteor Shower, an amateurastronomer saw “a bright light going from left to right, then straight up.”January 13th, 1999: Northern Territory, Australia. Astronomer Matthew Pearce, 23, spotted a UFO with histelescope while skywatching – “I observed an object due south, around 10 kilometres from Yulura. The objectresembled a star, silvery blue in colour. I heard no noise. Height around 15 degrees, southeast of Yulura, nearUluru. Visibility clear. It looked like a planet where there shouldn’t be one.

It was visible indifferent places all over Germany. In Austria, it is affirmed a sound of cracking or crushing came from it, as iffrom a thunderbolt, which, however, I take to be groundless.’ Johannes Kepler.Continue scrolling for more...March 21st, 1676: The Italian, Geminiano Montanari, was knowledgeable in geophysics, biology,mathematics, ballistics, and meteorology; but his greatest achievements are considered to have been inastronomy. He reported this sighting to Edmund Halley, who commented – ‘I find it one of the hardest thingsto account for, that I have ever yet met.’….. ‘It appeared one and three quarter hours after sunset, comingover the Adriatic from Dalmatia. It crossed over all Italy, at a height of some 40 miles, and hissed as it passed,over Ronzare. It passed over the sea from Leghorn to Corsica, with a sound like the rattling of a great cartover stones. I compute that it travelled 160 miles a minute. It seemed to be a vast body apparently biggerthan the moon!’ (FSOM/DSB)May 1677: ‘..the famous astronomer, Edmund Halley, Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford University,reported seeing a “great light in the sky all over Southern England, many miles high.”‘July 31st, 1708: ‘..from 9 to 10 p.m., a similar apparition, thought to be 50 miles high, passed overSheerness, and the ‘Buoy at the Nore,’ Suffolk, and London. It moved “with incredible speed, and was verybright. It seemed to vanish and left a pale white light behind it. There were no hissing sounds and noexplosion.”‘ (FSOM)1715: Unusual phenomena were observed on the Moon, at the time of the solar eclipse, by Edmund Halleyand J.E.de Louville – ‘..as it were a sort of flash or momentary vibrations of beams of light, as thoughsomeone were setting fire to gunpowder trails as used in mining. These bright flashes were very brief induration and appeared now here, now there, but always in the shade.’ (FSR 41-2)March 6th, 1716: Halley saw an object illuminating the sky for more than two hours from about 7:00 p.m.onwards: ‘A man could easily read print in the light thrown out by these spears from the same body. It did notchange for two hours, and then it seemed as if new fuel had been cast on a fire.’ / Similar phenomena werereported to Halley by other astronomers of his time, notably by astronomers Gottfried Kirch and Schlazius, atLeipzig, Germany re. an event on July 9th, 1686 and by Montanari an Italian mathematician and astronomerregarding a sighting on March 21st, 1676.March 17th, 1735: ‘A strange apparition of “an uncommon bright glade of light” was seen from the top of hishouse in Buckingham Street, off the Strand, London, by John Bevis, at 8.05 pm, on March 17, 1735, when hewas observing Mars, in the west: “It was quite unlike the Aurora Borealis, being steady and not tremulous inmotion. The stars could be seen through it. It was not a comet; for I could see no nucleus through my 17-footoptical glass. It gre dim in the middle in half an hour, and then seemed to split into two very luminous parts,which grew dimmer till about 9.” (FSOM)August 9th, 1762: Two Swiss astronomers saw an object in front of the sun. They were De Rostan in Basleand Croste in Sole. [Article in 18th Century Sightings]May 1764: Astronomer Hoffman saw a large round spot traverse the sun from north to south. (MHervey)June 17th, 1777: Charles Messier, famous for his nebula catalogue observed a large number of dark spots inthe skies, disc shaped, which were unknown to him. In his log book he wrote – ‘They were large and swift andthey were ships, yet like bells.’August 18th, 1783: Tiberius Cavallo, Italian chemist, inventor and writer on natural philosophy – a fellow ofthe Royal Society, saw at Windsor Castle what he termed a ‘most extraordinary meteor…North-east of theTerrace, in clear sky and warm weather, I saw appear suddenly an oblong cloud nearly parallel to the horizon.Below the cloud was seen a luminous body… It soon became a roundish body, brightly lit up and almoststationary. It was about 9.25 p.m. This strange ball at first appeared bluish and faint, but its light increased,2A List Of Sightings By Astronomersand it soon began to move. At first, it ascended above the horizon, obliquely towards the east. Then itchanged its direction and moved parallel to the horizon. It vanished in the SE. I saw it for half a minute, andthe light it gave out was prodigious. It lit up every object on the face of the country. It changed shape tooblong, acquired a tail, and seemed to split up into two bodies of small size. About two minutes later came arumble like an explosion.’ [Article in 18th Century Sightings]. Cavallo’s book ‘The History and Practice ofAerostation’ was published, in London, two year later. He was buried in 1809 in St.Pancras Churchyard.(FSOM)Also on August 30th an object was observed at Greenwich Observatory from which eight objects emerged,described as satellites. / Other reports by scientists named by Wilkins on the following dates: March 19, 1718at Oxford, December 5th, 1737 and December 16th, 1742 – both in London.William Herschel on Mars – ‘..From other phenomena it appears, however, that this planet is not without aconsiderable atmosphere; for, besides the permanent spots on its surface, I have often noticed occasionalchanges of partial bright belts.. and also a darkish one, in a pretty high latitude.. And these alterations we canhardly ascribe to any other cause than the variable disposition of clouds and vapours floating in theatmosphere of that planet.[Result of the contents of this paper] …And that planet has a considerable but moderate atmosphere, so thatits inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours.Datchet, Dec.1, 1783. W.HERSCHEL’ [On the remarkable Appearances at the Polar Regions of the PlanetMars, the Inclination of its Axis, the Position of its Poles, and its Spheroidal Figure; with a few Hints relating toits real Diameter and Atmosphere. By William Herschel, Esq. F.R.S.]October 22nd, 1790: ‘The famous astronomer, Frederick William Herschel, who discovered the planetUranus and its satellites and the satellites of Saturn, was looking through a 20-foot reflector telescope.. whenhe saw, in time of total eclipse of the moon, many bright and luminous points, small and round. But “thebrightness of the moon, notwithstanding the fact that it was in eclipse”, did not permit him to view thephenomenon long enough to locate these points on the lunar surface. / He wrote to the Royal Society – “Weknow too little of the surface of the moon to venture a surmise of the cause and remarkable colour of thesepoints.”‘ [Article in 18th Century Sightings]. Previous sightings of lights on or near the moon were made byHerschel in 1783 and 1787. (FSOM)May 1799: A luminous spot was seen moving across the disc of Mercury by Johann Schroeter, his assistantK.L.Harding at Lilienthal observatory , and other observers- ‘In the transit of 1799.. Schroter and Harding atLilienthal, and Kohler at Dresden, saw a small luminous spot on the dark disk. The spot was not stationary,for Harding saw it change its position, and later in the day Schroter saw it sometimes on one part of the disk,sometimes on another. Others saw, not one, but two small spots of a greyish colour.’ (Monthly Notices 38,1878/MU)February 7th, 1802: An unknown body [‘dark disc’ DL]was seen crossing the sun by the Astronomer Fritsch,at Magdeburg, in central Germany. (NL)October 10th 1802: An unknown dark body was seen by Herr Fritsch rapidly crossing the sun. (NL)January 16th 1818: A Mr.Capel Lofft, astronomer of Ipswich, England, observed a strange object near thesun. It was visible for three hours and a half. (DL/NL)June 26th, 1819: Three dark bodies crossed the sun together, observed by astronomer Franz Gruithuisen.(NL) Pastorff saw something near the sun, which he had thought was a comet; but could not have been,according to Olbers. (NL)September 7th, 1820: Francis Arago, the famous French Physicist/Astronomer describes observations thatday during the eclipse, at Embrun, of objects moving across the sky in a nearly military precision. Hementions also that a number of other scientists have seen similar events.3A List Of Sightings By AstronomersFebruary, 1821: A bright point of light, like a star, was seen on the Moon, in the crater Aristarchus – on the 4th& 7th of February, by Capt.Kater; on the 5th, by Dr.Olbers. Star-like lights on the moon also observed thatyear in May and November. (NL)October 23rd 1822: Astronomer Pastorff observes two unknown objects cross the sun’s disc. (DL)May 22nd 1823: Astronomer named Webb sees bright shining thing near Venus. (DL)October 18th, 1824: ‘At five o’clock, morning.. a light was seen upon the dark part of the moon, byGruithuisen. It disappeared. Six minutes later it appeared again, disappeared again, and then flashedintermittently, from 5:30 A.M., until sunrise ended the observations.’ (NL)January 22nd, 1825: A star-like light was again observed in Aristarchus, on the Moon; reported byRev.J.B.Emmett. (NL)February 13th, 1826: Gruithuisen reported that on this date, two straight lines of light, with, between them adark band that was covered with luminous points, was observed in the western crater of Messier.(NL)July 31st 1826: Unknown object seen by astronomers. (DL)May 26th 1828: Disc crossing the sun, seen through telescope. (DL)September 6th to November 1st, 1831: At Geneva Observatory the Swiss astronomer Dr.Wartmann and hisstaff saw a strange luminous body practically every night. / In the years following there were reports byPastorff (1834, 1836, 1837), Cacciatore (1835), De Vico (1837), De Cuppis (1837), and Glaisher (1844).July 4th, 1832: W.L.Webb saw ‘a brilliant display of minute dots and streaks of light, in the Mare Crisium..’ onthe Moon.

(NL)May 15th, 1836: At Havana, Professor Auber saw many luminous bodies that seemed to move out from thesun, in diverse directions. (BoD)1844: James Glaisher reported shining discs “which sent out quickly flickering waves of light.” (UFOsTSH)May 11th-13th, 1845: ‘Erman sends me a report of Capocci about bodies, which he has seen pass in front ofthe sun on 11 to 13 May… he has also seen bodies of indeterminate shape like shadows pass, and for thisreason the idea occurred to him that there could be nearer bodies and therefore that one must pull out theeyepiece further in order to see them clearly. In fact, when he pulled out the eyepiece 1 to 2 centimeters, hesaw these bodies pass by with a very definite outline. They had irregular shapes. A few went quickly likeshooting stars, others remained visible 2 to 3 seconds and so on.’ (Letter from astronomer HeinrichSchumacher to mathematician Carl Gauss, Sept.18 1845)… …G.A.Erman (1806-1877) worked chiefly interrestrial magnetism and related fields, and also undertook many expeditions. His father-in-law was Bessel…Ernesto Capocci (de Belmonte) (1798-1864) was the first astronomer at the Capidomente observatory inNaples, remaining there until 1848. (I.Grattan-Guinness, FSR 23-2)‘Italian astronomer working at Capodimonte Observatory, Naples saw a number of shining discs, some star-shaped, others sporting a tail-like appendage. He considered them of smallish size. / Further reports in thefollowing years came from Schmidt (1847), Brown and Sidebotham (1849) and Inglis in Switzerland in thesame year.’March 18th & 19th, 1847: Large luminous spots seen upon the dark side of the moon, and a general glowupon the upper limb, by Rev.T.Rankin and Prof.Chevaillier.

Later given the name ‘Vulcan’ by Urbain Leverrier, who had become aware of five other seperateobservations. (BoD)September 1st, 1859: Richard Carrington, oberving through his telescope at Redhill Observatory in Surreysaw two luminous bodies, certainly not meteors.April 1860: ‘..4 leading astronomers, Herrick, Buys-Barlott and de Cuppis of Great Britain, together with theirSwiss colleague Dr.Wolf, watched from the Zurich Observatory as “a large number of small black discs whichcame from the east flew past.” ‘ (UFOsTSH)October 1862: ‘Lockyer saw a spot like a long train of clouds on Mars, and several days later Secchi saw aspot on Mars..’ (NL)April 27th, 1863: Henry Waldner, a German astronomer, saw at Weinheim Observatory that day a greatnumber of small luminous bodies travelling at great speed. He notified Johann Wolf (professor of astronomysince 1855 at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule and the University at Zurich, Switzerland. Andthrough whose efforts an observatory was constructed in that city, in 1864). Dr.Wolf was convinced of thereality of the phenomenon, and told Mr.Waldner of the similar sighting by Sig. Capocci, 18 years earlier.(BoD/DSB)October 19th, 1863: Astronomer Schmidt saw ‘..a bolide that was following an exceptionally slow course. Hewas able to study it through a comet searcher and stated that it was a double object.’ (compare to Jan.3rd1898 sighting)March 8th, 1865: M.Coumbary, an amateur astronomer of Constantinople, saw ‘..a black point, sharplyoutlined, traverse the disk of the sun. It detached itself from a group of sunspots near the limb of the sun, andtook 48 minutes to reach the other limb..’ (BoD)August 10th, 1865: An astronomer named Ingall spotted ‘a most minute point of light glittering like a star’ onthe moon, just west of Picard.

This was at 7.30 p.m. At 9.30p.m., it faded out. “I have seen lights on the moon before, but never so clear as this.” ‘ Various otherobservations of anomalous features on the moon also detailed. (FSOM)May 30th, 1867: Bird, a British astronomer observing Venus, saw a number of objects similar to Capocci andWaldner.5A List Of Sightings By Astronomers1867: Professor Eduard Heis saw a dark object slowly traverse eleven degrees of arc of the Milky Way. (BoD)June 8th, 1868: A number of British astronomers at Oxford’s Radcliffe Observatory saw a luminous objectmoving quickly across the sky, stopping and changing its course at least three times.August 7th, 1869: Observing a total solar eclipse at Iowa Observatory Professor Zentmayer and Prof.Coffinsaw a number of objects moving nearly parallel across the sky. Also Prof.Himes of this observatory whencalled observed some of them. They were unexplainable to all three astronomers.October 17th & 18th, 1869: A keen amateur astronomer, Lieutenant Herschel while observing the sun saw,from noon on the 17th until about 7 a.m. on the 18th numerous dark shadows crossing the sun, and alsoluminous streaks going across the sky near the sun. They were nearly a continuous stream and allexplanations could not solve these sightings. Some objects stopped and hovered before flying fast away.May 13th, 1870: Multiple lights (4, 27, 28) observed from England in the lunar crater Plato – ‘..it was observedthat, as one of these lights.. increased in brightness, another diminished. Then another light alternately shoneand faded out…’ (FSOM)October 12th, 1870: ‘The astronomer William F.Dennis saw at Bristol a luminous ball travelling faster than aballoon but slower than a meteor, and emitting sparks. The same object, or one quite similar, was seen atWimbledon by a member of the Royal Society of Astronomy.’ (Michel)August 1st, 1871: A French astronomer, E.A.Coggia, known for cometary discoveries, saw, in Marseilles, anobject slowly moving across the sky, he was unable to explain. According to his description, it appeared at10:43 pm, and was a magnificent red object moving slowly eastward. At 10:52:30 pm it stopped, and thenmoved northward, until stopping again after a further seven minutes. Its next movement was once againtowards the east, finally disappearing, or falling behind the horizon at 11:03:20 pm. (NL)August 29th, 1871(?): Another leading French astronomer, Etienne Trouvelot, saw a great number ofseemingly opaque bodies crossing the sun, and similar sightings for some days until September 1st, 1871.June 17th, 1873: Dr.Sage, whilst watching the planet Mars, from Rybnik, Upper Silesia, saw a large object‘apparently issue’ at incredible speed from the planet, and seemingly explode on reaching Earth’satmosphere. There were other witnesses reported on by a Dr.Galle. (NL)1873: ‘..the royal British Society of Astronomy reported that for many months, flashing lights had been seenon the moon, which they took to be intelligent attempts by an unknown race from the moon to establishcontact..’ (UFOsTSH)April 24th, 1874: Prof. Schaffarik of Prague Observatory saw an unidentified object crossing the moon. Hereported that it was ‘..of such a strange nature that I do not know what to make of it. It was bright white andmoved slowly across the face of the moon. I saw it even after it had left the disc of the moon. In other words,the object was no part of the moon because it left the moon behind and wandered out into space. What elsecan it be other than a flying machine?’ (UFOsTSH)December 1875-January 22nd, 1876: Rio De Janeiro Observatory reported ‘..a vast number of bodiescrossing the sun, some of them luminous and some of them dark..’ (BoD)February 20th, 1877: That night, Etienne Trouvelot, French-born astronomer/scientist, resident in the U.S.,saw a fine luminous line, like a luminous cable drawn across the lunar crater Eudoxus.

To those who havepowerful telescopes these changes are of exceeding interest. I have not noticed so large a spot for manyyears. / The general contour of the “penumbra” is nearly circular and measures 56,037 miles in its longer axisand 51,106 miles in its shorter axis. The “umbra” is of an extraordinary shape from its numerousramifications. The greatest length of this is 39,266 miles and its greatest breadth 23,052 miles. / Thetelescope used in these measurements was an eight and a half inch equatorial, by Messrs. Cooke and Sons,York. / I beg to remain, Sir, yours obediently, FREDERICK BRODIE, F.R.A.S. Observatory Fernhill, Wootton-bridge, Isle of Wight…’November 17th, 1882: E.W.Maunder, Superintendent at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and others, sawa greenish object, torpedo-shaped and luminous.

He saw also at other times objects similar to this one: he even named them Bradytes.7A List Of Sightings By AstronomersApril 15th & 25th, 1883: At Marseilles, Monsieur Bruguiere observed bodies crossing the sun that were‘irregular in form. Some of them moved as if in alignment.’ (BoD)August 12th, 1883: Bonilla, director of Zacatecas Observatory, Mexico saw whilst observing sun-spots, notless than 283 bodies crossing the sun. He admits the count was only approximate, as many appeared at thesame time. Photos taken are still in existence – the earliest known UFO photos. Some objects were also seenthe following day. (UFOsTSH)February 5th, 1884: ‘Mr.Lopez Morales, Director of the Meteorological Observatory of Almeria (Spain): Onsome luminous red points observed on the Moon. On the subject of an analogous observation by Mr.JoseBraziliano de Souza (Brazil), the writer recalls an observation of 5 february 1884: at 2 o’clock in the morning,a portion of the lunar cirque in the form of a crescent appeared luminous in the walls of the crater Kepler, nearto Encke, the convexity directed to the South-East.’ (Societe Astronomique de France, Seance du 5 mars1890)February 7th, 1884: Astronomers at Brussels Observatory, Belgium did notice from that day until Feb.16th,an extremely bright spot on the planet Venus, which moved away from it on the 16th February.September 16th, 1884: Professor Haywood of Otterbein College, Westerville, Ohio, USA, reported thatbetween 3.30 and 4a.m., he had observed a bright glow covering the dark part of the Moon. Thoughconsidered by him to be an electrical manifestation – it was too bright to be earth shine and obscured thefeatures of the surface of the Moon – he admitted ‘This latter fact is puzzling and unsatisfactory.’February 21st & 22nd, 1885: ‘..Lorenzo Kropp, an astronomer of Paysandu, Uraguay, writes that, upon Feb.21, 1885, he had seen, in Cassini, a formation not far from Hercules, both of them in the northwesternquadrant of the moon, a reddish smoke or mist. he had heard that several other persons had seen, not amisty appearance, but a star-like light here, and upon the 22nd he had seen a definite light, himself, shininglike the planet Saturn.’ (NL)August 22nd, 1885: Two amateur astronomers, Reveillere and Guiberteau witnessed at Saigon aphenomenon lasting about eight minutes, an object crossing from south to southeast, red in colour, certainlymuch slower than a meteor.November 1st, 1885: A Turkish amateur astronomer, Mavrogordato, reported an elongated object, veryluminous, near Adrianapole, 4-5 times larger than the full moon. The time was about 9:30 p.m. Another reporton the next day near Skutari, Albania, forwarded through the same astronomer, described a blueish-greenishobject, making a series of turns before falling into the sea after 90 seconds.May 11th, 1886: Marseilles, France; 8pm. From sighting report by A.Fauchier – ‘..observing the Moon.. myattention was drawn to two points reflecting an extraordinarily brilliant light and of a kind that I had never seenthere before that day and that I have never seen again since; this light was iridescent and surpassed byseveral times in brightness the most luminous parts of this heavenly body seen in the same light conditions inother instances…’ These anomalous lights were witnessed at the south of Plato. (L’Astronomie 6) Completereport is in 19th Century sightings1886: Dr.Max Wolf saw something obscure a star for three and a half seconds. (BoD)November 30th, 1888(?): Palermo, Italy.

He could notexplain it.November 25th, 1894: ‘A light-reflecting body, or a bright spot near Mars – seen..by Prof.William Pickeringand A.E.Douglass, at the Lowell Observatory, above an unilluminated part of Mars – self-luminous, it wouldseem – thought to have been a cloud – but estimated to have been about twenty miles away from the planet.’(BoD)August 11th, 1895: ‘Remarkable Bolide. — I was the witness Sunday 11 August, at 9 in the evening, to acurious phenomenon. A bolide traversed the sky in a west to south direction between Ophiuchus and theScorpion. At the altitude of Ed Ophiuchus, the meteor split in two, and formed two glowing nucleii about 1deg. distant from each other, and connected by a luminous trail. In that manner, the two bolides followed thesame trajectory and lost themselves in the misty horizon. CHATELET, at Avignon.’ (L’Astronomie vol.9)September 16th, 1895: ‘Celestial Phenomenon. — Today, 16 September, at the time when a very clear skyadorned the town of Saint-Helier, I was watching, at 9.14 in the evening, from the window of my hotel, thegiant constellation of Cygnus, which was at the time situated around the zenith altitude, when a sheet ofintense and blinding light ran across the sky from North to South with breathtaking speed.As a passenger on board the steamer Le Honfleur, I was stunned during the crossing, by the exceptionalclearness of the firmament, made altogether more strange by a vaporous mist spreading out over the wholeof the sea. Several people that I spoke to about this unknown light affirmed to me that they had likewise seenit and that it was not an electric light.PAUL ROULAND, at Saint-Helier. Island of Jersey, September 1895.’ (L’Astr. v9)December 1895: Muller, of Nymegen, Holland saw a luminous object near Venus.July 31st, 1896: At Smith Observatory, U.S.A., astronomers noticed a dark circular disc-shaped object goingacross the moon’s surface very quickly, timed at about four seconds, which should prove its closeness toEarth. / Coming back to the moon and various observations of lights, etc., in England in the Seventies or so ofthe 19th century, an astronomer, Birt, deposited at the Royal Astronomical Society over 1500 observations oflights, moving objects and changes of brightness, mostly in the crater Plato, which is, with its about 60 milesdiameter quite a prominent feature of the moon.September 20th/21st, 1896: Echo Mountain, California, USA; evening. Dr.L.Swift observed a ‘luminousobject’ about one degree above the sun – ‘..Going out on the veranda, the object was seen more distinctly. Atfirst it occurred to me that it might be a small fire on the mountain, but this idea was quickly dispelled, as one-half of the sun’s disk was still above the mountain, and the object still higher. Seizing an opera glass I sawthat it had a very much fainter companion some 30′ north, but it could not be seen without the glass. In aboutfour minutes after the sun had set the two objects also disappeared behind the mountain. / Both objects wereseen by some fifteen people… Last evening I began a search with the comet-seeker with the sun 10[degreesign] in altitude, but nothing was seen until fully one half of the sun had disappeared when I caught sight of it,but its faintness surprised me, for it was less bright through the telescope than with the naked eye theprevious evening… / I only saw it for 5 seconds… I estimate that the object disappeared simultaneously withthe sun’s upper limb. / The only thing that perplexes me about this strange affair is, that the sun, object, andcompanion, were not in line, but must have deviated from it by 30 [degrees]or more.’ (The AstronomicalJournal XVII)January 3rd, 1898: At 8.40pm, a Monsieur Georget observed something unusual in the sky while returninghome – ‘..I saw in the northeast, at an elevation of 30-40 degrees, a luminous meteor, fairly bright, having thethe same colour as the planet Mars, travelling at a relatively slow rate through the sky. It went away toward9A List Of Sightings By Astronomersthe north and disappeared at the horizon at a point that formed an alignment with the satrs Zeta and EtaUrsae Majris, behind the hills situated to the north of Vannes, about eight or ten kilometres away, and about110 metres higher than the town itself. / It went through a trajectory of 45 degrees in five or six minutes,during which time it steadily lost brightness, as a luminous body would if it went away. About the time of itsdisappearance, one could see a yellow or reddish flash. / I was able to examine this meteor for a few minuteswith a small telescope of 30 mm.. It seemed to be formed by two luminous bodies, A and B, situated atapproximately the same elevation, the brighter one, A, being in front. Remarkable peculiarity: the motion of Bwas affected by sudden oscillations, which lasted about half a second. Four or five oscillations were countedper minute. These objects gave the appearance of two balloons linked together.’ When published in theperiodical Comptes Rendus, this sighting was compared to a sighting by Schmidt, on October 19th, 1863.(CTSc)April 25th, 1898: Prof. J.Michailovitch of Belgrade Observatory saw for about six minutes an object hoveringover Belgrade. He referred to it as a ‘comet,’ but it obviously did not behave like one.June 29th, 1898: A French astronomer, Lucien Libert, who was in the habit of observing and recordingmeteors at every possible opportunity, saw – ‘..at 1hr. 03m.A.M., a bolide with very slow motion (that) glided insixty seconds from Hercules to Ursa Major. Its diameter was 25 seconds of arc, and it was very bright andwhite in colour.’ (CTSc)July 4th, 1898: Lucien Libert – ‘..I was in my observatory when suddenly, at 7hrs. 10m. 18s., I saw a luminousbody appear above a tree at the northern horizon. It was of a beautiful golden-yellow colour and perfectlyspherical. Its apparent diameter was one-fourth that of the moon. This object started from the north-northeast,rose slowly in the sky, went through the zenith, then started losing brightness as it went down toward thehorizon. It disappeared at elevation 30 degrees above the above the west-southwest horizon, near Venus, at7hrs. 22m. 44s. Its duration, therefore, was twelve minutes, twenty-six seconds. It is by far the longestduration I have observed. A short time before it disappeared it increased its speed… A fairly strong noise ofexplosion was heard a few seconds after its disappearance.’ (CTSc)May 6th, 1899: Monsieur Libert, again – ‘..at 8:30 P.M., a magnificent bolide with a very, very slow motion, ofyellow colour and surrounded with a shower of sparks, appeared in the constellation of the Scale. Night hadnot completely come and it was difficult to ascertain points of comparison. Only Jupiter and Spica werevisible. This bolide had a completely peculiar shape, which I cannot compare to anything better than atadpole’s head. There was a very bright point in front, and a tail with extremely fast movements of undulation.’(CTSc)June 7th, 1899: M.Libert – ‘..at 9 hrs. 25m. 32s. P.M., a yellow bolide, very slow, of the magnitude of Venus,leaving no trail, went from Ophiuchus to Scorpio in twelve seconds. (CTSc)February 9th, 1902: M.Libert – ‘..at 7 hrs. 40m. P.M., I observed with MM.Schoux, Marcel Libert and LucienBriand an extremely remarkable bolide, of the magnitude of Venus. It started from the position of Capella, at apoint I estimate to be about five hours of right ascension and +45 degrees declination, and went on a straightline toward beta Persei, which it reached in about three seconds. Having reached the vicinity of this star, itsuddenly changed direction, followed a sort of loop and went toward Aldebaran with a curved trajectory.When it was about to disappear it split into three or four objects of approximately second magnitude. Thewhole observation had lasted about twelve seconds. the point of disappearance was about 4 hrs. 50m. ofright ascension and +20 degrees of declination. The bolide left a trail that lasted about one and one-halfminutes.’ (CTSc)November 20th 1902: ‘ (At) 9.27 a.m., Mr.Griffiths, the assistant astronomer at Adelaide Observatory andcolleague were taking weather observations when a “brilliant globular light” appeared to the SSE at about 45degrees elevation. It moved slowly north and remained visible until 9.31 a.m., covering about 20 degrees ofarc in that time, and was lost sight of about 45 degrees above the northern horizon. When it was nearoverhead it appeared elongated “and took an elliptical form” with its axis in the direction of motion. (FATA/BillChalker)10A List Of Sightings By AstronomersMay 25th, 1903: A body was seen on the terminator of Mars, later reported by Professor Percival Lowell, ofLowell Observatory. (BoD)December 24th, 1909: ‘..amateur astronomer, James Fergusen, of Limerick, Ireland, reported watching abrightly lighted object rise over the northeastern horizon, maneuvering generally southward for twentyminutes, then retracing its course and vanishing below the horizon at two minutes past nine…’ (FS-SB)May 22nd, 1911: ‘Curious meteoric phenomenon – On the 22 May, about 11.49 (Konigstahl mean time), afeeble meteor was observed following an oblique 4 deg. trajectory, going from east to west. It passed over thestar y of the Eagle with great speed. Its breadth was around 15′ and it disappeared, leaving behind it a lighttrail that faded immediately. Nevertheless, the star remained invisible at least three and a half seconds afterthe meteor’s disappearance, as if the light had been absorbed by the substance that this had abandoned inspace. Dr MAX WOLF Director of the Observatory of Heidelberg.’ (L’Astr. v25)January 27th-28th, 1912: Astronomer Frank B.Harris wrote to Popular Astronomy and The Times that hesaw “a huge object of some kind, moving across the moon’s surface.” He stated that the object was opaque,black, approximately 250 miles long and 50 miles wide, and close enough to the surface to cast a shadow onthe moon. Observation spanned 10.30pm-2am. (PA 20, 1912/MU)December 11th, 1915: At Glenorchy, Tasmania, astronomer Bernald Thomas saw “a particularly bright spot”on the north shore of the Mare Crisium that “looked like a star.” (English Mechanic, 203-12)December 1915: In the lunar crater Aristarchus, ‘a.. new black wall that had not been there before..’ wasobserved. It ran ‘..from the center to the rim..’ (FredSt)May 14th, 1916: At Cordoba Observatory, Argentina, astronomers Perrine and Glancy noticed an object,similar to a comet near the zenith, with ‘..proper motion of ten degrees an hour, visible one hour..’ (BoD)1918 approximately: Mr.Erwin Schoen, a native of Austria and (subsequently) a resident for many years inAustralia, while hiking near the Austrian ammunition town of Steyr with friends, saw during the First WorldWar, a round object, similar to the size of the full moon, cruising over Steyr. he was on a mountain at the timeand remembers that the object seemed to rotate, afterward moving in one direction. Visible 2-4 minutes.1922: ‘Three long artificial looking mounds, or objects, appeared on the floor of the (lunar) crater Archimedes.Later, three more objects were discovered not far away, composed in the form of a triangle.’ (FredSt)circa-1936: The 100 inch telescope at Mount Wilson, USA, aimed at the lunar crater Cassendi, photographed‘..a remarkable “tube system”.. while some of these constructions were growing, others have been removed..’(FredSt)October 1939: One night, at Wisconsin Rapids, in Wisconsin State, USA, ‘..an egg-shaped object with 8spots like portholes was observed through an astronomical reflector telescope..’ (FATA/NICAP)May 3rd, 1947: USA; Nighttime – ‘An amateur astronomer in Boulder, Colorado, after training his telescopeon the moon, saw a dark object hurtle across the disk of the moon in a horizontal straight line path.’ (Pr.N47)June 24th, 1947: The same day that Kenneth Arnold had his sighting of “Flying Saucers”, astronomer FredJohnson in Oregon saw these objects, according to his later declaration.July 3rd, 1947: Harborside, Maine, USA. At 2.30 pm, astronomer John Cole of South Brooksville, Maine,watched ten very light objects, with two dark forms to their left, for 10-15 seconds. They moved like a swarmof bees, and a loud roar was heard. (PrBBE) ‘..Air Material Command publicly explained it as birds or insects,although the Air Force’s Project Grudge later listed the sighting as an “unusually well-supported incident” withno explanation..’ (Dolan)11A List Of Sightings By AstronomersJuly 10th, 1947: An eliptical UFO was seen by astronomer Dr.Lincoln La Paz and his family near PortSumner, New Mexico, (driving) by car with wife and child. He saw a luminous unknown object sort ofoscillating beneath the clouds. Its brightness was stronger than the planet Jupiter and its shape regular andelliptical. The nature of this object was unknown to the astronomer.Info from Life 5/5/52 article: ‘The object “..exhibited a sort of wobbling motion” and then disappeared behindsome clouds. It reappeared and “projected against the dark clouds gave the strongest impression of self-luminosity.” The object then moved slowly from south to north and two and a half minutes behind acloudbank. / According to the astronomer’s calculations, confirmed by his wife, who with their two daughterswas with him, the object was 235 feet long and 100 feet thick. Its horizontal speed ranged between 120 and180 miles per hour and its vertical rise between 600 and 900 miles per hour.’ (JGuieu)June or July 1947: Jyvaskyla, Finland – ‘A technician who was also an amateur astronomer was reading abook after midnight and saw a metallic cigar-shaped object flying at a distance of about two kilometers fromnorthwest to southeast. A bluish light was seen at the end of the cigar. It was flying a lot faster than theairplanes of the time. the observation lasted about 30 seconds.’ (Pr.N47)1948: ‘F.H.Thornton.. saw a brilliant flash of light at the western rim of Plato. He likened it to the flash of anantiaircraft shell exploding in the air ten miles away.’ (SEMoon)April 24th, 1949: Charles Moore, a highly qualified meteorologist, whilst launching a weather balloon saw anelongated object at White Sands proving grounds, crossing the horizon in about one minute. The sighting wasseen by five others. Similar sightings were also at the same place earlier that month.August 20th, 1949: Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet Pluto in 1930, saw at about 10:45 p.m. whilesitting outside his home at Las Cruces, New Mexico, with his wife and mother-in-law, between six and eightgreenish objects which were travelling soundlessly across the sky. He reported – ‘In all of my severalthousand hours of night sky-watching, I have never seen anything so strange as this. I was so astonished thatmy impression of it was somewhat confused. How I wished I could have had some binoculars at hand. Nosound whatever.’ (Michel)Letter from Clyde Tombaugh to Richard Hall, dated September 10th 1957: ‘Dear Mr.Hall: Regarding thesolidity of the phenomenon I saw: My wife thought she saw a faint connecting glow across the structure. Theilluminated rectangles I saw did maintain an exact fixed position with respect to each other, which would tendto support the impression of solidity. I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, becausesome similarity to it should have appeared many times. I do a great deal of observing (with telescopic andunaided eye) in the backyard and nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since.’ (AId/TUE)1949: Witness Bertrand Collin, New Zealand – ‘My second sighting.. I was studying the stars through mytelescope when suddenly four objects in doamond formation passed overhead. They had stubby flangesinstead of wings, with short thick bodies. They looked dark, and did not shine. the next morning, thenewspapers carried reports of mysterious cobweb-like substance falling from the sky and draping itself acrossfences and telegraph wires, which melted on being touched.’ (MHervey)Christmas Eve, 1949: Witness Mr.R.Henderson, Melbourne, Australia – ‘As an ex-member of theAstronomical Society, and with considerable knowledge of the appearance of meteors, planets, etc., I know aUFO when I see one. The object I saw is still vivid in my memory… I first sighted, in my usual admiration ofthe stars, a UFO. At an angle of 30 degrees in a north-west direction, I saw a bright orange light travelling dueeast across the northern section of extreme northern suburbs; this is the opposite direction of travel of stars,etc. / The UFO stopped about 10 degrees east of north, at about a 30-degree elevation. It remainedstationary for some time and pulsed with a regular steady beat of light, but now a dull red colour instead oforange it had whilst travelling along. / In its stationary position the dull red colour was almost hard to see; theUFO was still stationary but after about twenty minutes in this position it became brighter. It went from dull redto bright red, and then to bright orange. At a terrific speed it went from 10 degrees north to a position slightlynorth from my east viewpoint. It slowed down from bright orange to its usual red to its pulsating dull red whilststationary again. It remained in this stationary position for about fifteen to twenty minutes. / From this position12A List Of Sightings By Astronomersit went due south, to a position SSE and a bright orange whilst in motion, where it again became stationaryand a dull red colour. This time it remained only a short time and proceeded in a north-westerly directionalmost overhead across the city at a terrific speed and bright orange.’ (MHervey)February 16th, 1950: Mount Hamilton, Santa Clara County, California – ‘Dr.C.D.Shane, an astronomer at LickObservatory saw and made 8 photographic plates of a queer flying object very high in the sky and movingunusually fast. He considered it one of the most unusual objects sighted in the sky, and saw it only bychance.’ (UFOPhATW/FSOM)March 2nd, 1950: ‘MEXICO CITY, March 11 (U.P.). The director of a Mexican observatory today produced aphotograph of a flying saucer but it looked more like an amateur’s snapshot of a klieg light. / The photographwas a black square with a diagonal band of light across it. The caption in the newspaper Excelsior said it was“possibly the only picture of a flying saucer which existed outside of the larger countries.” / Luis Enrique Erro,director of the Tonantzintla Astronomical Observatory where the photograph was made, said: “The strangeobject crossed the sky March 2. Since that day we have wondered what it could have been. We don’t know.” /Meanwhile, dozens of reports of flying saucers poured into the capital from all over Mexico. The “saucercraze” began shortly after a Mexico City newspaper printed a series of articles which appeared in Timemagazine.’March 9th, 1950: ‘Next day, March 9, the saucer again visited Durango at noon. This time its movements andappearance were carefully checked by a scientist. E.Nuncio, professor of astronomy in the technical school ofDurango, studied the saucer through a telescope and other instruments. Afterwards he gave his data to thepress. Nuncio said that the saucer maintained 40,000 feet altitude. It was shaped somewhat like a child’s top,and had fracture bands around it where its material was joined together. The tip or point of the top was red,and was tilted down and toward the east. Its altitude over the horizon was 53 degrees 20 minutes and itsposition was southeast. While Nuncio checked, the saucer moved toward the last 3 degrees in each fiveminutes until it was out of sight. He pointed out that Venus and other heavenly bodies move to the west.’(True 6-50 in LG6)March 11th, 1950: ‘On that day, also, the astronomical observatory at Culiacan watched a disk-like objectthrough the telescope, and in Tampico, Tamaulipas, amateur astronomer Gonzalo Ibanez reported watching asaucer through his telescope at 9 p.m. in the direction of the Great Bear Constellation. It moved toward thesoutheast at a great velocity.’ (True 6-50 in LG6)March 27th, 1950: Berlin, Germany – An inexplicable body of a brilliance that rivalled the North Star, wasseen by astronomers zigzagging its way westward, occasionally pausing.May 6th, 1950(?): Palomar Gardens, California – At 3.30pm, Amateur astronomer Mr.George Adamski‘..observed and photographed a huge bright cigar shape crossing the face of the Moon..’ He also ‘..shot apicture of 3 luminous UFOs near the limb of the Moon..’ (UFOPhATW/CotS/FSHL)May 20th, 1950: Seymour Hess, an astronomer at Flagstaff Observatory, Arizona, saw a metallic lookingdisc, unexplainable to him:(From AId/TUE) ‘..between 12.15 & 12.20 p.m., Dr.Seymour L.Hess, a meteorologist, astronomer, and anexpert on planetary atmospheres, observed a bright, at least partially spherical object in the sky from thegrounds of Lowell Observatory. According to his account of the incident, which he wrote within one hour ofthe sighting, the object was definitely neither a bird nor an airplane, as it had no wings or propellers. Althoughit appeared to be very bright against the sky, as it passed between Hess and a small cumulous cloud in theNorthwest its colour appeared dark. Based on the object’s elevation and angular diameter as he perceived itthrough 4-power binoculars, Hess calculated its size to be approximately 3 to 5 feet. Judging from themovement of the clouds, which were drifting at right angles to the motion of the object, he estimated that theobject must have been moving at about 100mph and possibly as fast as 200 mph. However, he neither sawnor heard any sign of an engine. Dr.Hess was head of the Department of Meteorology at Florida StateUniversity as of 1964.’13A List Of Sightings By Astronomers‘Astronomer says disc he saw wasn’t plane FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., May 23.- (U.P.) – Seymour L.Hess, Lowellobservatory astronomer, said today he saw a bright disc cutting through the clouds and that it “definitely wasnot an airplane.” / He said in a signed statement that he spotted the object in the southwestern skies around12:15 p.m. last Saturday. / Through four-power binoculars, it looked at first like a parachute, he said. / “Butthis may have been just the section of one-half of a spherical object, the other half being in shadows. Theobject presented a visible disc to the naked eye. It definitely was not an airplane.” / Williams Air Force basenear Phoenix, Ariz., disclaimed any knowledge of the object. The Air Force repeatedly has denied theexistence of flying saucers.’ (FSOA)May 27th, 1950: Palomar Gardens, California – At 8.30 pm ‘..George Adamski observed and photographedthrough his telescope two luminous objects seen against the Moon..’ / At 10.30 pm, he ‘..observed andphotographed two lens-shaped luminous flying objects in the sky an estimated 75 and 100 miles distant. Hemade the pictures through his home-made telescope and camera set-up.

Not until four years later, after resumption of observational survey ofthe region and referring to his earlier work did he realise that the floor of Herodotus is almost featureless andthat it certainly does not contain a central elevation! Subsequent research and consultation with his observercolleagues revealed the following: – 1) It had previously been noted by him in Nov.1949 though unwittingly. 2)It was independently seen by the English selenographer Dr.H.P.Wilkins in March 1950. 3) Recovered againon July 27th, 1950. It has not been seen since by Dr.Bartlett. (Uranus)August 25th, 1950: ‘(Patrick) Moore says that “flashes on the Moon are very rare indeed.

Professor WalterN.Webb, Chief Lecturer on Astronomy of the Charles Hayden Planetarium in Boston, was acting as naturecounselor at a boys’ camp on the shores of Silver Lake – ‘..He had been letting the boys observe variouscelestial objects through a small telescope.. (when) he noticed a glowing yellow or yellow-red light moving inan undulating path over the hills at the south end of the lake.. He quickly ruled out the possibility of its havingbeen an inversion effect of some ground-based lights, because the conditions for such a phenomenon werenonexistent…’ The light’s wavelike trajectory and its very low altitude also meant that it could not be identifiedas either a plane or planet.

Marie L.Martin, who had ‘a very great interest in astronomyand in any flying aircraft,’ was gazing up at the sky. It was a brilliant afternoon. She noticed what she took tobe a jet aircraft travelling extremely fast, and was then shocked to see what she assumed to be its two wingsleave the fuselage. However, it then transpired that instead of the detached objects coming ‘hurtling down’and the jet crashing, ‘..without any loss of speed, they went round, one behind the other, so that in a straightline they continued to race across the sky.

The rays or beams of light could be seen distinctly from the dome and attached directlybeneath it was a much larger and flattened dome with a protruding band running in a circumference aroundits edge. This was clearly seen in the telescope by the rays of light thrown out from the apertures in the topdome. The underneath of the large flattened bottom dome was hollow and appeared to be glowing red, butthere were no vapour trails or gases to be seen. / It did not rotate but kept the same portion of the dometowards the telescope until it changed its angular course. Then it gave me a chance to visualise another ofthe apertures that previously had been hidden from view. It was then travelling to the north-east anddisappearing from view.” (ACA)January 3rd, 1954: ‘Mr.John W.Boyle, vice-president of the Victoria (Australia) branch of the BritishAstronomical Association, saw at 11 a.m.. visible for 30 seconds, what at first looked like a “piece of paper”blown by the wind, at a height of about 30,000 feet. But there was little wind, and the object resolved itselfinto something like aluminium, rocking from side to side and flashing in the sunlight. each time it flashed, ahalo of purple shone round it..

An astronomer told the RCMP that she had seen “a dark arrowhead-shapedobject – three times the size of a jumbo jet – with orange-yellow lights at the tips.” She reportedly told theHerzberg Institute of Astrophysics that there “..was absolutely no sound, and the speed was incredible.

A female amateur astronomer and her six-year-olddaughter looking into the sky directly overhead saw “..a fuzzy white light.. like the Comet Hyakutake”descending in an arc toward the horizon, moving very rapidly. It stopped falling just above some trees, andthe woman viewed it for 15 minutes with her telescope. It “..did not decrease in its intensity” as a meteorwould, and was “much larger than a star.” The UFO stopped, travelled horizontally to the left, stopped again,travelled to the right a short distance, stopped once more, then moved straight up and straight down. Finally,it veered leftward and was gone. (UFORup, 1-9)May 5th, 1996: Wayne, New Jersey, USA; 10.12pm. A party of amateur astronomers set up their telescopeon a hillside, hoping to get good views of Venus, then prominent on the western horizon. The first astronomerpeering through the telescope’s eyepiece saw “..a bright flash near Venus.” S/he said, “At first I thought it wassome sort of meteor exploding in the upper atmosphere.” Another member of the group described theexplosion as “A whitish-green colour.”When the first astronomer looked again, s/he could make out a grey saucer shape with “..two bright lights onthe top of the dome. It was about the size of a two-bedroom house.” There were two transparent “glassblisters” fore and aft of the object’s dome.

    "content": "Date of Occurrence:Past Nine YearsDate Reported:April 24, 2005Location:Moved from California to Ocean Shores, Washington in 2004Number of Witnesses:SixNumber Witnesses Interviewed:FourDescription (Written April, 2005):While on a speaking engagement at the recent Ocean Shores, WA UFO conference I came across a man and his son who claim to have had numerous contacts with unknown entities.  The man and his two kids claim to have had these contacts.  (He has a daughter and son.)  The boy says that he regularly sees reptile-like entities (mostly at night).  He wakes up with blotches or sores on his arm after these experiences.  These sores have been treated by a physician using antibiotics, but the sores continue to persist.  According to the father the doctors are baffled by the cause of these sores.  The father also has some marks on his leg as the result of encounters with unknown beings.  (See above photo.)  I interviewed both the father and his son.  His daughter was not interviewed.  The father and daughter see the classic “small grey” beings while the son sees reptile-like beings.Update by Investigator Joe Ryan (August 19, 2005):This is an anthology of memories beginning at about the time the father was twelve years old – in about 1977 or so – and continues until this year: – last sighting by his son about six months ago.  (Note the father will be referred to as “F”, the son as “S”, and the daughter as “D” in the anthology of sightings.)1977:F was sitting on his parents’ property in San Jose, California with a friend back in 1977 casually observing the overhead skies. The last thing on either F’s mind or that of his friend was anything as peculiar as UFO’s, yet both suddenly jumped up yelling “UFO!” before running in opposite directions. But that wasn’t the odd facet of that particular “sighting.” When they reconvened at the spot from where they dashed off, neither of them could remember seeing anything at all. This “non-sighting” was to begin a strange series of occurrences that have surrounded his entire family – parents, siblings, and in recent years, his children, now 13 and 16 years old.Continue scrolling for more...Around 1982:After more than five years had passed, at about the age of eighteen, F was picked up after work by a friend with a motorcycle. He was on the back seat when they pulled into a 7-11 Convenience Store. Neither F nor his friend had been on drugs (common in those years, but not part of the F’s lifestyle) nor had he even had a beer for more than a week. Suddenly a strange flying object appeared just overhead. It was smoky in appearance, but otherwise vague and ill-defined in shape during its brief manifestation. F recalls that both he and his friend yelled something like “That was weird!” before driving back to his home where they sat motionless (basically, regaining their composure) in the garage-turned-bedroom. It was about 12:30 a.m. and D asked his friend, Tony, if he would stay and wake him at six the next morning. When Tony went to set an alarm clock, he remarked, “it is six o’clock!” Both of the young menhad lost six hours. Again, F wanted it very clear that he had not had even a single beer for at least a week prior to this event.Later in 1982:During that same year – a little later in the springtime or early summer – Tony and F were driving along in the foothills near San José, California (on Callabaros Road, he recalls) with F’s sister when a similar smoky (amorphous) object appeared over the hood of their car. That was when they all saw a triangular-shaped object traveling down the valley directly over them. F’s sister “freaked out” and they were all quite frightened, of course. What they saw was enormous. It was only about 3 − 400 feet above them and was the “size of a battleship!” Although there were discernible lights on the underside, most of the lights seemed to be on the sides of the triangle. The triangle was very large, flat and clearly triangular. To indicate its size, F said that at first they only saw one end of it going overhead. Its speed was slow, estimated by F to be 10-15 mph. Although they couldn’t see the “back end” of the triangle at first, it ultimately passed over. At no time did they see the entire triangle, but when it had blocked the starry sky almost entirely, its shape was clear. The only sound that F recalls is/was that of a low-pitched hum with a slight sound of what he could best describe as grinding gears. Such sightings would not end that night and the details became clearer in later years.Around 1990:About two years later, when F was about twenty years old, he was leading a youth group (“getting ‘street kids’ off the streets!” he smiled) at a ranch near his home. They were at a location known as “Silver Rock” and the youngsters had dug a pit around the rock for having a barbecue. This was a religious group and they had begun to pray with the group’s worship leader (Ian) when one of the youngsters looked up and saw something odd. He yelled out for the others to look up and they did, including F, of course. What they saw was remarkable. A very bright star overhead was swinging in a pendulum-like manner, silently swinging to and fro. The boys pointed at it as they motioned to each other to ensure that they weren’t just seeing some sort of irregular motion caused by the clouds and stars criss-crossing one another. As far as F knew the night was clear and there were no clouds, but the sight was dazzling. Some of the boys remarked, “That’s God!” and who was to deny anything at that moment? This lasted for a full five minutes or more before the bright star simply faded away. Thereafter, F has had dreams that reflected the oddity of that and the earlier sightings. One time, he heard someone in his bedroom and remembered asking “Who are you” and “What are you doing in my room?” He remembers one such occurrence in 1990 or 1991 prior to the family moving to Santa Cruz and then, Modesto, California. F was diagnosed during this time as having M. S. (multiple sclerosis) and ultimately ended up living with his parents home in Modesto, California nearly entirely paralyzed. As it turned out, a lesion in his vertebrae (T2 – T3 upper spine) was the cause and, at one time, was told by the doctors that he would never again walk and would likely die. He did walk and he did live.Later (Date Not Known):F believes that his recovery was due to additional sightings similar to the one with the youth group. For example, while lying in his bed at his parents’ home he again saw the “pendulum star” swinging to and fro in the sky. This time, he called his mother and brother and all three watched the strange sight in the sky. They were transfixed for at least twenty minutes as best he recalls. His mother now lives very near the investigator assigned to this case and corroborating information will be collected soon. At this time and other times when watching the “pendulum star,” they noted that it emitted a red light like a trail – but not a streak of red light, he pointed out – periodically and usually tired them after several minutes of viewing. One time, he had a dream after such a sighting and heard the same humming sound and grinding gears (sound) that he associated with the large triangle. He felt the wonderful sensation of floating during much of the dream. When he awoke, the dream was still vivid in his mind and he clearly, while very much awake, saw the light shoot off and disappear. Of possible importance was that he saw two or three helicopters about a week later. He didn’t recall any markings on the helicopters. Of definite importance to F was that he felt much better in the weeks following the sightings of the “pendulum star” and gained at least 30 pounds – which, at the time was very, very good. He also discontinued having problems wetting the bed – due to his paralysis – and his general appetite improved considerably. Also, he was suddenly able to walk, first with a walker and then with a cane – all within a couple of weeks of the sighting and strange vivid dream. When he went to visit the doctor who had been treating him, the doctor repeated his name over and over – he simply couldn’t believe that it was F. He did not recognize him at all at first. In F’s mind, it was the light that had so wonderfully affected his health. It was also about this time that he became strangely “aware” that he had actually been abducted, for lack of a better word. He had been taken . . . somewhere! Or at least he believes so.Later Experience (Date Unknown):Some time later, F went for a visit to Marina, California with his mother and his brother. By this time, it was not so unusual for his mother, his brother and F himself to see the “pendulum star” and indeed, they saw a wonderful display over the ocean one evening. That particular sighting was memorable in that the newspapers reported “Light Seen Over Ocean” over one of its stories the next day. Also, they took more careful note of the star itself and noticed that it had a tinge of yellow around its circumference. As time passed, F married and had two children (now 13 and 15 in 2005). At one point during the early to mid-nineties, the entire family – including his mother and new stepfather moved into the Sierras. The children remained with their mother. During these many months, they literally saw the lights every night! The low cloud cover near the ocean versus the clearer skies in the Sierras was possibly the reason, but whatever, the lights became a regular spectacle. The spectacle included the emission of the red light from the larger white (tinged with a yellow “halo”) light on a regular basis. One time, he awoke to see the light either near or on the ground in a golf course near their home. He simply stared at it until the light “blipped out,” and then he returned to sleep. He often saw “flashes” of grays (the typical UFOlogy-common “grays”) in the back of his mind. Although by this time he was convinced he was being surreptitiously abducted, he never recalls having had “fear” over this aspect of his strange sightings, dreams and feelings.1997:His two children came often to visit and they watched the lights with him. The investigator queried the children (now teenagers) and they corroborated F’s stories. The younger child “S” is in the process of drawing a rather detailed drawing of the “beings” that he saw on more than one occasion in conjunction with the sightings during these years and continuing until as recent as six months ago. It looks to the investigator similar to a “Gray,” but has scaly Reptilian-like skin. F had at least 20 – 30 occasions of “sleep paralysis” which he described as being awake, but unable to open his eyes. Often, he sees beings, like “ghosts” (to use F’s word to describe them) in his room in the middle of the night. He asks them, “Who are you?” “What do you want?” “What’s your name?” but gets no replies. He said that he believes that they come to him “when he really needs them.” The children chose to want to live with him rather than their mother, and, at one time a lawyer had to be consulted. The children have seen the lights on and off for almost their entire lives – until now – 2005. F has even gone to an elderly pastor and asked if they might be angels or even God. Whatever, it was shortly after a series of such sightings of the “pendulum star” that he secured custody of the children eight years ago. With the entire family, including the children, living in the Sierras, the now intact family would watch the “dancing lights” on a nightly basis. Both children agree as to the nature of the lights themselves, but “D”, 15 described more “traditional” grays whereas her brother S, 13 described hybrid Gray-Reptilian creatures with scaly skin and red eyes, although humanoid features otherwise. The children recalled a slightly different account of the red lights emitted by the larger white light. They both noted that the white light would seem to swoop down and “catch” the red lights before dropping it again on a fairly regular basis.2003-Early 2005:Only S has reported seeing anything during 2005 (six or seven months ago), but both describe having seen the “light shows” regularly until about one and a half years ago – winter of 2003-2004. These were in the foothills about one and a half hours from Yosemite and also about one and half hours from Lake Tahoe. Additional interviews with the children – apart from the father or grandmother – will be accomplished in the weeks to come.Other Sightings (Dates Approximately from 1998 – 2003 With About a Year and a Half Between Each Sighting):F’s mother has had three  sightings of “globes” or disks that move back and forth (laterally) in perpendicular patterns for long periods of time. F’s mother observed this same phenomenon in three different areas (One of these sightings was in Modesto, California; the next was in Marina, California and the third was in Arnold, California – all after they had moved into new homes in each of these locations). All three of the sightings were quite dramatic and involved a large globe-like light (at least half the size of a full moon and round in shape) moving back and forth across the sky – first in a roughly north-south path, back and forth, and then in a roughly east-west path, back and forth. The speed was enormous, but she was unable to guess at just how fast the ball or disk was traveling. After making one or two such back-and-forth passes, the object would stop suddenly (she said “on a dime”), sit still for as long as twenty seconds, and then take up back-and-forth movements in a more or less perpendicular path. It was as if the object were searching for something on the ground, but it was completely silent. She was with F. and a brother the first time, was alone with F the second time and with F, and his two children (D and S) the third time. As in F’s account above, the object was bright white. She recalled newspaper accounts after at least one of the sightings (Modesto) where several persons in the area saw the same object(s).Investigator’s Notes:The family all says that they have had repeated sightings of UFOs and some encounters with beings.  Recently the daughter (D) has been somewhat less certain about some of her experiences.  (This change in attitude could be due to her being concerned about reports of her experiences on this website. We assured her that her identity would not be revealed in any reports.) Recently Joe Ryan has interviewed F’s mother.  She has corroborated some of the sightings when she was present with the family.  We plan to do more analysis of the testimony of the witnesses in this case.  A psychological assessment also will be performed on this case. Any new information will be posted.codepeople-post-map require JavaScriptFollow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave",

    "all_content": "Date of Occurrence:Past Nine YearsDate Reported:April 24, 2005Location:Moved from California to Ocean Shores, Washington in 2004Number of Witnesses:SixNumber Witnesses Interviewed:FourDescription (Written April, 2005):While on a speaking engagement at the recent Ocean Shores, WA UFO conference I came across a man and his son who claim to have had numerous contacts with unknown entities.  The man and his two kids claim to have had these contacts.  (He has a daughter and son.)  The boy says that he regularly sees reptile-like entities (mostly at night).  He wakes up with blotches or sores on his arm after these experiences.  These sores have been treated by a physician using antibiotics, but the sores continue to persist.  According to the father the doctors are baffled by the cause of these sores.  The father also has some marks on his leg as the result of encounters with unknown beings.  (See above photo.)  I interviewed both the father and his son.  His daughter was not interviewed.  The father and daughter see the classic “small grey” beings while the son sees reptile-like beings.Update by Investigator Joe Ryan (August 19, 2005):This is an anthology of memories beginning at about the time the father was twelve years old – in about 1977 or so – and continues until this year: – last sighting by his son about six months ago.  (Note the father will be referred to as “F”, the son as “S”, and the daughter as “D” in the anthology of sightings.)1977:F was sitting on his parents’ property in San Jose, California with a friend back in 1977 casually observing the overhead skies. The last thing on either F’s mind or that of his friend was anything as peculiar as UFO’s, yet both suddenly jumped up yelling “UFO!” before running in opposite directions. But that wasn’t the odd facet of that particular “sighting.” When they reconvened at the spot from where they dashed off, neither of them could remember seeing anything at all. This “non-sighting” was to begin a strange series of occurrences that have surrounded his entire family – parents, siblings, and in recent years, his children, now 13 and 16 years old.Continue scrolling for more...Around 1982:After more than five years had passed, at about the age of eighteen, F was picked up after work by a friend with a motorcycle. He was on the back seat when they pulled into a 7-11 Convenience Store. Neither F nor his friend had been on drugs (common in those years, but not part of the F’s lifestyle) nor had he even had a beer for more than a week. Suddenly a strange flying object appeared just overhead. It was smoky in appearance, but otherwise vague and ill-defined in shape during its brief manifestation. F recalls that both he and his friend yelled something like “That was weird!” before driving back to his home where they sat motionless (basically, regaining their composure) in the garage-turned-bedroom. It was about 12:30 a.m. and D asked his friend, Tony, if he would stay and wake him at six the next morning. When Tony went to set an alarm clock, he remarked, “it is six o’clock!” Both of the young menhad lost six hours. Again, F wanted it very clear that he had not had even a single beer for at least a week prior to this event.Later in 1982:During that same year – a little later in the springtime or early summer – Tony and F were driving along in the foothills near San José, California (on Callabaros Road, he recalls) with F’s sister when a similar smoky (amorphous) object appeared over the hood of their car. That was when they all saw a triangular-shaped object traveling down the valley directly over them. F’s sister “freaked out” and they were all quite frightened, of course. What they saw was enormous. It was only about 3 − 400 feet above them and was the “size of a battleship!” Although there were discernible lights on the underside, most of the lights seemed to be on the sides of the triangle. The triangle was very large, flat and clearly triangular. To indicate its size, F said that at first they only saw one end of it going overhead. Its speed was slow, estimated by F to be 10-15 mph. Although they couldn’t see the “back end” of the triangle at first, it ultimately passed over. At no time did they see the entire triangle, but when it had blocked the starry sky almost entirely, its shape was clear. The only sound that F recalls is/was that of a low-pitched hum with a slight sound of what he could best describe as grinding gears. Such sightings would not end that night and the details became clearer in later years.Around 1990:About two years later, when F was about twenty years old, he was leading a youth group (“getting ‘street kids’ off the streets!” he smiled) at a ranch near his home. They were at a location known as “Silver Rock” and the youngsters had dug a pit around the rock for having a barbecue. This was a religious group and they had begun to pray with the group’s worship leader (Ian) when one of the youngsters looked up and saw something odd. He yelled out for the others to look up and they did, including F, of course. What they saw was remarkable. A very bright star overhead was swinging in a pendulum-like manner, silently swinging to and fro. The boys pointed at it as they motioned to each other to ensure that they weren’t just seeing some sort of irregular motion caused by the clouds and stars criss-crossing one another. As far as F knew the night was clear and there were no clouds, but the sight was dazzling. Some of the boys remarked, “That’s God!” and who was to deny anything at that moment? This lasted for a full five minutes or more before the bright star simply faded away. Thereafter, F has had dreams that reflected the oddity of that and the earlier sightings. One time, he heard someone in his bedroom and remembered asking “Who are you” and “What are you doing in my room?” He remembers one such occurrence in 1990 or 1991 prior to the family moving to Santa Cruz and then, Modesto, California. F was diagnosed during this time as having M. S. (multiple sclerosis) and ultimately ended up living with his parents home in Modesto, California nearly entirely paralyzed. As it turned out, a lesion in his vertebrae (T2 – T3 upper spine) was the cause and, at one time, was told by the doctors that he would never again walk and would likely die. He did walk and he did live.Later (Date Not Known):F believes that his recovery was due to additional sightings similar to the one with the youth group. For example, while lying in his bed at his parents’ home he again saw the “pendulum star” swinging to and fro in the sky. This time, he called his mother and brother and all three watched the strange sight in the sky. They were transfixed for at least twenty minutes as best he recalls. His mother now lives very near the investigator assigned to this case and corroborating information will be collected soon. At this time and other times when watching the “pendulum star,” they noted that it emitted a red light like a trail – but not a streak of red light, he pointed out – periodically and usually tired them after several minutes of viewing. One time, he had a dream after such a sighting and heard the same humming sound and grinding gears (sound) that he associated with the large triangle. He felt the wonderful sensation of floating during much of the dream. When he awoke, the dream was still vivid in his mind and he clearly, while very much awake, saw the light shoot off and disappear. Of possible importance was that he saw two or three helicopters about a week later. He didn’t recall any markings on the helicopters. Of definite importance to F was that he felt much better in the weeks following the sightings of the “pendulum star” and gained at least 30 pounds – which, at the time was very, very good. He also discontinued having problems wetting the bed – due to his paralysis – and his general appetite improved considerably. Also, he was suddenly able to walk, first with a walker and then with a cane – all within a couple of weeks of the sighting and strange vivid dream. When he went to visit the doctor who had been treating him, the doctor repeated his name over and over – he simply couldn’t believe that it was F. He did not recognize him at all at first. In F’s mind, it was the light that had so wonderfully affected his health. It was also about this time that he became strangely “aware” that he had actually been abducted, for lack of a better word. He had been taken . . . somewhere! Or at least he believes so.Later Experience (Date Unknown):Some time later, F went for a visit to Marina, California with his mother and his brother. By this time, it was not so unusual for his mother, his brother and F himself to see the “pendulum star” and indeed, they saw a wonderful display over the ocean one evening. That particular sighting was memorable in that the newspapers reported “Light Seen Over Ocean” over one of its stories the next day. Also, they took more careful note of the star itself and noticed that it had a tinge of yellow around its circumference. As time passed, F married and had two children (now 13 and 15 in 2005). At one point during the early to mid-nineties, the entire family – including his mother and new stepfather moved into the Sierras. The children remained with their mother. During these many months, they literally saw the lights every night! The low cloud cover near the ocean versus the clearer skies in the Sierras was possibly the reason, but whatever, the lights became a regular spectacle. The spectacle included the emission of the red light from the larger white (tinged with a yellow “halo”) light on a regular basis. One time, he awoke to see the light either near or on the ground in a golf course near their home. He simply stared at it until the light “blipped out,” and then he returned to sleep. He often saw “flashes” of grays (the typical UFOlogy-common “grays”) in the back of his mind. Although by this time he was convinced he was being surreptitiously abducted, he never recalls having had “fear” over this aspect of his strange sightings, dreams and feelings.1997:His two children came often to visit and they watched the lights with him. The investigator queried the children (now teenagers) and they corroborated F’s stories. The younger child “S” is in the process of drawing a rather detailed drawing of the “beings” that he saw on more than one occasion in conjunction with the sightings during these years and continuing until as recent as six months ago. It looks to the investigator similar to a “Gray,” but has scaly Reptilian-like skin. F had at least 20 – 30 occasions of “sleep paralysis” which he described as being awake, but unable to open his eyes. Often, he sees beings, like “ghosts” (to use F’s word to describe them) in his room in the middle of the night. He asks them, “Who are you?” “What do you want?” “What’s your name?” but gets no replies. He said that he believes that they come to him “when he really needs them.” The children chose to want to live with him rather than their mother, and, at one time a lawyer had to be consulted. The children have seen the lights on and off for almost their entire lives – until now – 2005. F has even gone to an elderly pastor and asked if they might be angels or even God. Whatever, it was shortly after a series of such sightings of the “pendulum star” that he secured custody of the children eight years ago. With the entire family, including the children, living in the Sierras, the now intact family would watch the “dancing lights” on a nightly basis. Both children agree as to the nature of the lights themselves, but “D”, 15 described more “traditional” grays whereas her brother S, 13 described hybrid Gray-Reptilian creatures with scaly skin and red eyes, although humanoid features otherwise. The children recalled a slightly different account of the red lights emitted by the larger white light. They both noted that the white light would seem to swoop down and “catch” the red lights before dropping it again on a fairly regular basis.2003-Early 2005:Only S has reported seeing anything during 2005 (six or seven months ago), but both describe having seen the “light shows” regularly until about one and a half years ago – winter of 2003-2004. These were in the foothills about one and a half hours from Yosemite and also about one and half hours from Lake Tahoe. Additional interviews with the children – apart from the father or grandmother – will be accomplished in the weeks to come.Other Sightings (Dates Approximately from 1998 – 2003 With About a Year and a Half Between Each Sighting):F’s mother has had three  sightings of “globes” or disks that move back and forth (laterally) in perpendicular patterns for long periods of time. F’s mother observed this same phenomenon in three different areas (One of these sightings was in Modesto, California; the next was in Marina, California and the third was in Arnold, California – all after they had moved into new homes in each of these locations). All three of the sightings were quite dramatic and involved a large globe-like light (at least half the size of a full moon and round in shape) moving back and forth across the sky – first in a roughly north-south path, back and forth, and then in a roughly east-west path, back and forth. The speed was enormous, but she was unable to guess at just how fast the ball or disk was traveling. After making one or two such back-and-forth passes, the object would stop suddenly (she said “on a dime”), sit still for as long as twenty seconds, and then take up back-and-forth movements in a more or less perpendicular path. It was as if the object were searching for something on the ground, but it was completely silent. She was with F. and a brother the first time, was alone with F the second time and with F, and his two children (D and S) the third time. As in F’s account above, the object was bright white. She recalled newspaper accounts after at least one of the sightings (Modesto) where several persons in the area saw the same object(s).Investigator’s Notes:The family all says that they have had repeated sightings of UFOs and some encounters with beings.  Recently the daughter (D) has been somewhat less certain about some of her experiences.  (This change in attitude could be due to her being concerned about reports of her experiences on this website. We assured her that her identity would not be revealed in any reports.) Recently Joe Ryan has interviewed F’s mother.  She has corroborated some of the sightings when she was present with the family.  We plan to do more analysis of the testimony of the witnesses in this case.  A psychological assessment also will be performed on this case. Any new information will be posted.codepeople-post-map require JavaScriptFollow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave\n\n"

    "content": "The following was written by Stanton Friedman on March 3, 2005. It is part ofThe Stanton Friedman Collectionas archived here on The Black Vault.Peter Jennings ProgramBy Stanton T. FriedmanBy the time you read this you will have read a ton of verbiage about the February 24 Peter Jennings’s ABC “UFOs: Seeing is Believing.” I think it is appropriate for me to comment since so many people sent me emails about it. Almost all were sympathetic about what they considered the unfair treatment that I and the Roswell incident received.Continue scrolling for more...The producers in Roswell interviewed me for over an hour in July, 2004. Don Schmitt who has been active in Roswell research for many years was also interviewed. He and a film crew actually went out to the site, which was marked out for more archeological digging. I believe about 20 seconds of my interview was shown with none of Don’s nor of the scientific work site. I had been cautiously optimistic after hearing a few weeks before the showing that I had made the cut, but that 100 people had not. My optimism decreased when I heard that Seth Shostak, Frank Drake, and Jill Tartar, (SETI Specialists) and Michael Shermer, skeptic, were going to be on. Despite all their writing about SETI, it was clear that none knew anything about UFOs. Proclamation is not the same as investigation. I had jokingly told people that, after all, Peter Jennings and I were both dual citizens of the USA and Canada and, surprisingly, both had been born on July 29. How could I not trust him? I didn’t place enough emphasis on the fact that Benito Mussolini was also born on July 29.I was favorably impressed with the first portion with interviews with aircraft crew members, comments about Blue Book’s focus on explaining away sightings and the interview with Major Friend whom I had met at Blue Book in the early 1960s. The second half of the show was like a horror film. The SETI people waxed poetic about their wonderful search for ET Signals. There was no indication of any knowledge of UFOs other than one of the sillier moments of the show when Jill Tartar described having a sighting of the moon partially obscured by clouds. This was worth recreating?? One can see why the SETI people don’t want to deal with eyewitness testimony. I think one could also see why I say that SETI stands for Silly Effort to Investigate and why I talk of the cult of SETI: Charismatic hand waving, very strong dogma (they must be out there, they can’t be coming here, we will make the most important discovery in Man’s history a signal from a distant civilization, and nobody could possibly come here — if they did, we would be out of a job) and strong irrational claims about the absence of evidence. Meaning “we don’t dare review it.” Dr. Tyson joined the crowd and proclaimed that eyewitness testimony may be OK in court, but not in science. Tell Jane Goodall that.Several times PJ used the term “mainstream science” along with a proclamation about its non-acceptance of UFO reality. No evidence was presented. It appears that the only mainstream science he was talking about was astronomy. Think of chemists, biologists, geologists, us physicists, etc. Much of science today was based on eyewitness testimony of something unusual. Think Roentgen and X-rays. I believe that most mainstream scientists like me believe that the methodology has to suit the problem. Unpredictable, brief appearances of strange craft (not under the control of the observer or of Mother Nature) behaving in strange ways require eyewitness testimony as, of course, do airplane crashes, crimes, etc. Shostak proclaims when he finds a signal they will tell everybody else who will then verify it and anybody can use his own antenna. What happens if the transmission stops? How many can afford their own Hat Creek Telescope System? Does he think the signal will be “Testing 1, 2” repeated over and over again? That we can order the saucer to stop while we do measurements?PJ claimed that mainstream science doesn’t accept the UFO evidence. This was yet another misrepresentation. Polls have consistently shown that the greater the education the more likely to accept UFO reality. Two polls of R and D people showed that about 2/3 of them who expressed an opinion said flying saucers were real. But then they live in the real world unlike the SETI cultists.The program contained, as might be expected, based on past experience, a major putdown on star travel from people who know absolutely nothing about space travel. We were told that the Voyageur spacecraft, our fastest space craft launched 30 years ago, will take 73,000 years to reach the nearest star and that the fastest man made object goes only 11 miles per second compared to the speed of light at 186,000 miles per second. Wow! Sounds like we sure can’t get there from here. These are both totally misleading. The Voyager hasn’t been attached to a propulsion system since it left the vicinity of the earth!! It is coasting. This is like tossing a bottle into the ocean or a feather in the air as a basis for estimating crossing time for the Queen Mary 2 or the SST or the space station.We physicists have accelerated particles in the vacuum chambers of expensive accelerators to speeds of 99.99% of the speed of light. Eleven miles per second is absurd. Space is a very large vacuum chamber. These totally misleading comments rank on a par with Dr. Simon Newcombe’s claim in October, 1903 (2 months before the Wright Brothers’ first flight) that the only way man would fly would be with the help of a balloon. Dr. Bickerton in the 1920s proved “scientifically” that it would be impossible to provide enough energy to put anything into orbit. Dr. Campbell in 1941 “scientifically” calculated that the required initial launch weight of a rocket able to get a man to the moon and back would be a million million tons. He was, because of his total ignorance about space flight, off by a factor of 300,000,000. All three were, like the SETI cultists, astronomers. With this track record, why believe any of their proclamations? I was involved more than 40 years ago in work on a fusion propulsion system able to eject particles having 10 million times as much energy per particle as in a chemical rocket. This, of course, was not presented. After all, I was just a promoter.A real hatchet job was done on Budd Hopkins in the show’s segment on UFO abductions. The witnesses were OK, but then we have the off-the-wall proclamations about sleep paralysis being the explanation coupled with hypnosis to generate false testimony from the witnesses. All the data provided by Budd about the fact that many abductions don’t take place in bed (think Betty and Barney Hill, Travis Walton, etc), that there are many cases when more than one person is abducted (is sleep paralysis contagious?), that at least 30% of abduction investigations do not involve hypnosis, and there are physical markings, was left on the cutting room floor. Budd has worked with over 600 abductees. Had the 2 Harvard psychologists worked with more than a dozen? Why wasn’t any of Harvard psychiatrist John Mack’s interview run? The pronouncement that there is no benefit of hypnosis in memory enhancement is false. Phil Klass made the same claim to me, but stopped when I provided an article about a stonemason being able, under hypnosis, to describe tiny details on a particular stone that he had placed years earlier.Finally we have the Roswell segment. I was introduced as a Roswell promoter. The term was used twice. There was no mention of the fact that I was a nuclear physicist who had worked for the likes of GE, GM, Westinghouse, etc. The totally unjustifiable term “myth” was used at least twice. PJ should be ashamed. Jesse Marcel junior was filmed. There was no mention of the fact that he is a medical doctor, a Flight surgeon Colonel in the reserve, and serving in Iraq despite being 67. His father was called an intelligence officer, but without adding that the group was the most elite military group in the world, the 509th, which had dropped the A-bombs on Japan. Don’t these facts go to credibility? Of course I am a Roswell promoter, based on 27 years of research and investigation and the outlay of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours and finding loads of supporting testimony, visits to 20 Document Archives, all ignored by the noisy negativists and none presented in the program.At the request of the producers I had provided a total of 57 videos from which they used a few clips. One video was the 105-minute “Recollections of Roswell” which included testimony from 27 witness including Retired General Thomas Jefferson DuBose. He told me of taking the call from General Clements McMullen, head of SAC, who was the boss of 8th Air Force Commander Roger Ramey (who was DuBose’s boss) ordering him to get the press off their back, send some wreckage up here today, and never talk about it again.For reasons unknown they had historian Robert Goldberg tell the Roswell tale although he was seriously in error in his description of Roswell in his book about conspiracies and on the show. They gave Karl Pflock quite a bit of time with his Roswell debunking. They blindly accepted the Mogul Balloon explanation even though there is no evidence to support it, the materials characteristics don’t match witness testimony, and the dates and locations are wrong. They stressed the high security for Mogul — vastly overstated since several launches were allowed to just drop in the desert, no chase planes or ground teams. At least the crash test dummies weren’t paraded. I have dealt with all the objections in my MUFON 2003 paper “Critiquing the Roswell Critics.”The real promoters on the show were the SETI cultists with their myths. They have no evidence of any kind that there is anybody out there, that there are signals being sent, that they can receive and interpret such signals if there are any, using our primitive technology. An AM radio can’t pick up FM signals. They can’t admit that there is overwhelming evidence of alien visitation.It appears that the producers were perfectly willing to present some interesting testimony though they left out things like Project Blue Book Special Report 14, or other large scale scientific studies, and the statement by AF General Carroll Bolender that reports of UFOs which could effect national security were not part of the Blue Book system. But the three areas of investigation that clearly together establish both the cover-up and that the planet is being visited (Roswell and the abductions and the fact that interstellar travel is feasible with reasonable trip times) were trashed. Sounds like when push came to shove they lacked any courage at all. It was nice to give a neat segment at the end of the program to Dr. Michio Kaku saying that maybe visitors are well ahead of us and can warp space and time. Fusion propulsion systems are much closer in time. Blacked out and whited out government UFO documents force one to the conclusion that the government is not just incompetent with Blue Book, but lying through its teeth.Perhaps I should mention that only 11.6 million people watched the show. The Unsolved Mysteries program on NBC in 1989 about Roswell was seen by over 28 million people the first time around and 30 million the second time.Particularly irritating was the frequent mention of lights in the sky, billions of stars, and absence of physical evidence. There was not even the slightest mention of Ted Phillips’s 3000+ excellent physical trace cases from 90 countries. Why show Chris McKay digging in desert dirt and not the traces left by a UFO?Frankly, I was also bothered by the proclamations by nasty noisy negativist retired USAF officer James McGaha. We had a full-scale debate in Tennessee. The video is noted at my website www.stantonfriedman.com. It is easy to say we need both sides. But is that true when one does his research by investigation and the other does it by proclamation?Over the years I have been involved in the making of a number of documentaries about UFOs. These include “UFOs ARE Real,” “Flying Saucers ARE Real (2 Vols.),” “Stanton T. Friedman IS Real!,” “Do you Believe in MAJIC?” and in numerous interviews for a wide variety of producers of shows that have aired on the History Channel, The Discovery Channel, TLC, etc. Therefore, I am really puzzled about certain aspects of the Peter Jennings’s Productions UFO special seen on ABC on February 24, 2005. The word is that 150 people were interviewed and only 50 made the cut. That is far more than would be required for a 2-hour special. I had heard just before the broadcast that an interview was done with Harvard psychaitrist Dr. John Mack that would not be used. It surely would have made a good counterweight to the two Harvard psychologists falsely explaining away abductions as sleep paralysis enhanced with hypnosis. It was only after the broadcast that I found out how many extended interviews with very sharp people hadn’t been used. Richard Hall, Dr. Richard Haines, Dr. David Jacobs, Dr. Bernard Haisch, John Schuessler, John Greenewald, Ted Roe of NARCAP, etc. I saw the people who interviewed Don Schmitt (no air time) and myself (20 seconds, and referring to me as a promoter twice, and calling Roswell a myth at least twice) in Roswell with Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. None of this is in the PJP show. Crews for PJP travelled a lot including, for example, to the MUFON Conference in Denver. There was no mention of MUFON in the program though CUFOS was given a lot of time with old footage of Dr. J. Allan Hynek as well. Strangely he was portrayed as a courageous loner, the only one standing up to the debunkers — a totally misleading portrayal. The question thus arises as to why spend at least many hundreds of thousand dollars to collect far more footage than could possibly be used? Perhaps they will do another special using “the good stuff?” I doubt it.But if one wanted a real state-of-the-art survey of ufology on who knows what, is there a better cover story than that a company linked to Peter Jennings, the last remaining Big Time Network news anchor, is making a hard-hitting 2-hour special? People are flattered to be asked to contribute. Many of us were questioned for more than an hour. It might also be possible when reviewing the tapes to get clues as to who might be speaking out of turn. The crews were very tight about who all they talked to. Is it really surprising that the harshest attacks came down on Roswell, the reality of abductions and the reality of interstellar flight? Glorifying the Silly Effort To Investigate cultists provides a great deal of misdirection away from the reality of UFOs and the government cover-up. The footage would be a feast for the minions of whatever group is taking Majestic 12’s place to help plan their strategy for debunking and also for possible future release of data. I suspect they are also collecting reactions to the program. I would really like to collect the names of those who were interviewed but didn’t make the cut besides those given above.Follow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave",

    "all_content": "The following was written by Stanton Friedman on March 3, 2005. It is part ofThe Stanton Friedman Collectionas archived here on The Black Vault.Peter Jennings ProgramBy Stanton T. FriedmanBy the time you read this you will have read a ton of verbiage about the February 24 Peter Jennings’s ABC “UFOs: Seeing is Believing.” I think it is appropriate for me to comment since so many people sent me emails about it. Almost all were sympathetic about what they considered the unfair treatment that I and the Roswell incident received.Continue scrolling for more...The producers in Roswell interviewed me for over an hour in July, 2004. Don Schmitt who has been active in Roswell research for many years was also interviewed. He and a film crew actually went out to the site, which was marked out for more archeological digging. I believe about 20 seconds of my interview was shown with none of Don’s nor of the scientific work site. I had been cautiously optimistic after hearing a few weeks before the showing that I had made the cut, but that 100 people had not. My optimism decreased when I heard that Seth Shostak, Frank Drake, and Jill Tartar, (SETI Specialists) and Michael Shermer, skeptic, were going to be on. Despite all their writing about SETI, it was clear that none knew anything about UFOs. Proclamation is not the same as investigation. I had jokingly told people that, after all, Peter Jennings and I were both dual citizens of the USA and Canada and, surprisingly, both had been born on July 29. How could I not trust him? I didn’t place enough emphasis on the fact that Benito Mussolini was also born on July 29.I was favorably impressed with the first portion with interviews with aircraft crew members, comments about Blue Book’s focus on explaining away sightings and the interview with Major Friend whom I had met at Blue Book in the early 1960s. The second half of the show was like a horror film. The SETI people waxed poetic about their wonderful search for ET Signals. There was no indication of any knowledge of UFOs other than one of the sillier moments of the show when Jill Tartar described having a sighting of the moon partially obscured by clouds. This was worth recreating?? One can see why the SETI people don’t want to deal with eyewitness testimony. I think one could also see why I say that SETI stands for Silly Effort to Investigate and why I talk of the cult of SETI: Charismatic hand waving, very strong dogma (they must be out there, they can’t be coming here, we will make the most important discovery in Man’s history a signal from a distant civilization, and nobody could possibly come here — if they did, we would be out of a job) and strong irrational claims about the absence of evidence. Meaning “we don’t dare review it.” Dr. Tyson joined the crowd and proclaimed that eyewitness testimony may be OK in court, but not in science. Tell Jane Goodall that.Several times PJ used the term “mainstream science” along with a proclamation about its non-acceptance of UFO reality. No evidence was presented. It appears that the only mainstream science he was talking about was astronomy. Think of chemists, biologists, geologists, us physicists, etc. Much of science today was based on eyewitness testimony of something unusual. Think Roentgen and X-rays. I believe that most mainstream scientists like me believe that the methodology has to suit the problem. Unpredictable, brief appearances of strange craft (not under the control of the observer or of Mother Nature) behaving in strange ways require eyewitness testimony as, of course, do airplane crashes, crimes, etc. Shostak proclaims when he finds a signal they will tell everybody else who will then verify it and anybody can use his own antenna. What happens if the transmission stops? How many can afford their own Hat Creek Telescope System? Does he think the signal will be “Testing 1, 2” repeated over and over again? That we can order the saucer to stop while we do measurements?PJ claimed that mainstream science doesn’t accept the UFO evidence. This was yet another misrepresentation. Polls have consistently shown that the greater the education the more likely to accept UFO reality. Two polls of R and D people showed that about 2/3 of them who expressed an opinion said flying saucers were real. But then they live in the real world unlike the SETI cultists.The program contained, as might be expected, based on past experience, a major putdown on star travel from people who know absolutely nothing about space travel. We were told that the Voyageur spacecraft, our fastest space craft launched 30 years ago, will take 73,000 years to reach the nearest star and that the fastest man made object goes only 11 miles per second compared to the speed of light at 186,000 miles per second. Wow! Sounds like we sure can’t get there from here. These are both totally misleading. The Voyager hasn’t been attached to a propulsion system since it left the vicinity of the earth!! It is coasting. This is like tossing a bottle into the ocean or a feather in the air as a basis for estimating crossing time for the Queen Mary 2 or the SST or the space station.We physicists have accelerated particles in the vacuum chambers of expensive accelerators to speeds of 99.99% of the speed of light. Eleven miles per second is absurd. Space is a very large vacuum chamber. These totally misleading comments rank on a par with Dr. Simon Newcombe’s claim in October, 1903 (2 months before the Wright Brothers’ first flight) that the only way man would fly would be with the help of a balloon. Dr. Bickerton in the 1920s proved “scientifically” that it would be impossible to provide enough energy to put anything into orbit. Dr. Campbell in 1941 “scientifically” calculated that the required initial launch weight of a rocket able to get a man to the moon and back would be a million million tons. He was, because of his total ignorance about space flight, off by a factor of 300,000,000. All three were, like the SETI cultists, astronomers. With this track record, why believe any of their proclamations? I was involved more than 40 years ago in work on a fusion propulsion system able to eject particles having 10 million times as much energy per particle as in a chemical rocket. This, of course, was not presented. After all, I was just a promoter.A real hatchet job was done on Budd Hopkins in the show’s segment on UFO abductions. The witnesses were OK, but then we have the off-the-wall proclamations about sleep paralysis being the explanation coupled with hypnosis to generate false testimony from the witnesses. All the data provided by Budd about the fact that many abductions don’t take place in bed (think Betty and Barney Hill, Travis Walton, etc), that there are many cases when more than one person is abducted (is sleep paralysis contagious?), that at least 30% of abduction investigations do not involve hypnosis, and there are physical markings, was left on the cutting room floor. Budd has worked with over 600 abductees. Had the 2 Harvard psychologists worked with more than a dozen? Why wasn’t any of Harvard psychiatrist John Mack’s interview run? The pronouncement that there is no benefit of hypnosis in memory enhancement is false. Phil Klass made the same claim to me, but stopped when I provided an article about a stonemason being able, under hypnosis, to describe tiny details on a particular stone that he had placed years earlier.Finally we have the Roswell segment. I was introduced as a Roswell promoter. The term was used twice. There was no mention of the fact that I was a nuclear physicist who had worked for the likes of GE, GM, Westinghouse, etc. The totally unjustifiable term “myth” was used at least twice. PJ should be ashamed. Jesse Marcel junior was filmed. There was no mention of the fact that he is a medical doctor, a Flight surgeon Colonel in the reserve, and serving in Iraq despite being 67. His father was called an intelligence officer, but without adding that the group was the most elite military group in the world, the 509th, which had dropped the A-bombs on Japan. Don’t these facts go to credibility? Of course I am a Roswell promoter, based on 27 years of research and investigation and the outlay of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours and finding loads of supporting testimony, visits to 20 Document Archives, all ignored by the noisy negativists and none presented in the program.At the request of the producers I had provided a total of 57 videos from which they used a few clips. One video was the 105-minute “Recollections of Roswell” which included testimony from 27 witness including Retired General Thomas Jefferson DuBose. He told me of taking the call from General Clements McMullen, head of SAC, who was the boss of 8th Air Force Commander Roger Ramey (who was DuBose’s boss) ordering him to get the press off their back, send some wreckage up here today, and never talk about it again.For reasons unknown they had historian Robert Goldberg tell the Roswell tale although he was seriously in error in his description of Roswell in his book about conspiracies and on the show. They gave Karl Pflock quite a bit of time with his Roswell debunking. They blindly accepted the Mogul Balloon explanation even though there is no evidence to support it, the materials characteristics don’t match witness testimony, and the dates and locations are wrong. They stressed the high security for Mogul — vastly overstated since several launches were allowed to just drop in the desert, no chase planes or ground teams. At least the crash test dummies weren’t paraded. I have dealt with all the objections in my MUFON 2003 paper “Critiquing the Roswell Critics.”The real promoters on the show were the SETI cultists with their myths. They have no evidence of any kind that there is anybody out there, that there are signals being sent, that they can receive and interpret such signals if there are any, using our primitive technology. An AM radio can’t pick up FM signals. They can’t admit that there is overwhelming evidence of alien visitation.It appears that the producers were perfectly willing to present some interesting testimony though they left out things like Project Blue Book Special Report 14, or other large scale scientific studies, and the statement by AF General Carroll Bolender that reports of UFOs which could effect national security were not part of the Blue Book system. But the three areas of investigation that clearly together establish both the cover-up and that the planet is being visited (Roswell and the abductions and the fact that interstellar travel is feasible with reasonable trip times) were trashed. Sounds like when push came to shove they lacked any courage at all. It was nice to give a neat segment at the end of the program to Dr. Michio Kaku saying that maybe visitors are well ahead of us and can warp space and time. Fusion propulsion systems are much closer in time. Blacked out and whited out government UFO documents force one to the conclusion that the government is not just incompetent with Blue Book, but lying through its teeth.Perhaps I should mention that only 11.6 million people watched the show. The Unsolved Mysteries program on NBC in 1989 about Roswell was seen by over 28 million people the first time around and 30 million the second time.Particularly irritating was the frequent mention of lights in the sky, billions of stars, and absence of physical evidence. There was not even the slightest mention of Ted Phillips’s 3000+ excellent physical trace cases from 90 countries. Why show Chris McKay digging in desert dirt and not the traces left by a UFO?Frankly, I was also bothered by the proclamations by nasty noisy negativist retired USAF officer James McGaha. We had a full-scale debate in Tennessee. The video is noted at my website www.stantonfriedman.com. It is easy to say we need both sides. But is that true when one does his research by investigation and the other does it by proclamation?Over the years I have been involved in the making of a number of documentaries about UFOs. These include “UFOs ARE Real,” “Flying Saucers ARE Real (2 Vols.),” “Stanton T. Friedman IS Real!,” “Do you Believe in MAJIC?” and in numerous interviews for a wide variety of producers of shows that have aired on the History Channel, The Discovery Channel, TLC, etc. Therefore, I am really puzzled about certain aspects of the Peter Jennings’s Productions UFO special seen on ABC on February 24, 2005. The word is that 150 people were interviewed and only 50 made the cut. That is far more than would be required for a 2-hour special. I had heard just before the broadcast that an interview was done with Harvard psychaitrist Dr. John Mack that would not be used. It surely would have made a good counterweight to the two Harvard psychologists falsely explaining away abductions as sleep paralysis enhanced with hypnosis. It was only after the broadcast that I found out how many extended interviews with very sharp people hadn’t been used. Richard Hall, Dr. Richard Haines, Dr. David Jacobs, Dr. Bernard Haisch, John Schuessler, John Greenewald, Ted Roe of NARCAP, etc. I saw the people who interviewed Don Schmitt (no air time) and myself (20 seconds, and referring to me as a promoter twice, and calling Roswell a myth at least twice) in Roswell with Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. None of this is in the PJP show. Crews for PJP travelled a lot including, for example, to the MUFON Conference in Denver. There was no mention of MUFON in the program though CUFOS was given a lot of time with old footage of Dr. J. Allan Hynek as well. Strangely he was portrayed as a courageous loner, the only one standing up to the debunkers — a totally misleading portrayal. The question thus arises as to why spend at least many hundreds of thousand dollars to collect far more footage than could possibly be used? Perhaps they will do another special using “the good stuff?” I doubt it.But if one wanted a real state-of-the-art survey of ufology on who knows what, is there a better cover story than that a company linked to Peter Jennings, the last remaining Big Time Network news anchor, is making a hard-hitting 2-hour special?

    "content": "UPDATED 7/11/2017 WITH GAIA INTERVIEW ADDRESSING SKEPTICAL QUESTIONS – SEE BELOW.BackgroundFor those of you who follow The Black Vault, you will know I try to keep a logical, COMMON SENSE, approach to all things paranormal and conspiracy.  My detailed critique of the“Roswell Slides”gave those curious, but critical, minds something to reference as the story unfolded. The story ultimately ended up being a misidentified artifact, or possibly, an outright hoax. You decide which one – but it was NOT alien.Now, only two years after that story broke, another “mummy” has appeared on the internet. This one, a three-fingered mummy, is being publicized by Gaia.com and investigative journalist Jaime Maussan, the same man who happens to be the one who publicized the “Roswell Slides” story above.Please note: Before I get into this critique, let me say I am a friend to the Gaia network. I have appeared multiple times on their shows, and am friends with many of those who are involved with the network. My critique is NOT against Gaia, but rather, against the specimen being investigated. I mean no offense to any of those connected to this project, and offer my critique for those that are interested.  Also note that all images and corresponding photos are used for reference purposes, and the copyright is maintained by their respective owners.According to Gaia.com, their mission statement is the following:Continue scrolling for more...“Travel down a new road with Gaia, a member-supported conscious media company. Join our community of seekers, dreamers, and doers to empower your own evolution of consciousness. Discover over 8,000 ad-free, streaming titles to inspire and encourage curiosity. Everything is waiting for you; which path will you choose?”On June 20, 2017, Gaia released the following promotional trailer on YouTube and multiple social network channels promoting their newest series of videos coming to the online streaming network:Gaia posted a very simple and short description for this video:A new anomalous discovery has been unearthed in Peru. Join Gaia’s ongoing investigation and decide for yourself if this is proof of a non-human species.Within hours, it received hundreds of thousands of hits — and within 5 days — it was viewed more than 20 MILLION views on Facebook alone.  Case in point: the world was watching and they were interested. But is this exactly what it is being portrayed?Let’s start to dissect.In fairness, Gaia is not labeling this new find “alien” but rather, a “New Species” as tagged on their video.  They depict the mummy, with a graphical animation, looking like this:It is this representation which has many to believe, although Gaia is not saying “alien”, they are implying it with the graphic resembling that of a “grey alien” often depicted in alien abduction stories.  In fairness again, “grey aliens” are humanoid in appearance given the many differing descriptions, so Gaia could not have ever escaped that critique by those who wanted to throw the implication.So let’s move on.There are many issues with the Nazca Mummy which have many, including myself, asking a lot of questions.I found many different threads online talking about this story, many different websites touting it as proof of aliens, and even Snopes got into the action by labeling it a hoax — but to my disappointment —Snopeslabeled it a hoax on their page, offering very little actual substance stating WHY it was a hoax.  So, I created this page to offer a much more detailed critique of this story.This page will evolve as the story unfolds so check back often for updates.The ProblemsI think for the sake of this field of study, one must truly look critically at a story, and dissect all the angles before labeling it a hoax. Unlike Snopes, we can’t just label it a hoax simply because evidence has never supported the existence of alien life in the past, like they state on their page:However, no evidence has ever definitively proved the existence of alien life, and countless “alien” discoveries have later been shown to be hoaxes or to have far more mundane explanations.That’s an unfair statement to make, since Snopes themselves acknowledge that Gaia only posed the question of an alien, but never labeled it as such.So, let’s take a look at the red flags (in my book) about this story, that will (hopefully) one day be addressed by Gaia, Jaime Maussan or by any of those involved in this research project.  They are listed here in no particular order.The white plaster-like appearance of the Mummy is unlike others discovered from the same time frame and region.This is one of the biggest red flags, which is often cited by skeptics of this case.  No one can help but see a similarity between a plaster made model, and this mummy.  I began researching mummies found in the same region, from around the same time frame, and can not (at the time of writing this critique) find references that this embalming method was commonplace for the region.   You can see the plaster-like material disintegrate on the small platform as the mummy is handled. (This either supports the substance is very much plaster-like and possibly not an indicator of a real mummy, OR it supports the lack of scientific method used with this artifact, see below for more information on that).You can see that whatever the “outer coating” is of the mummy, it is disintegrating while the mummy is being handled.For reference, I was able to find a shelf full of mummies from the Chachapoyas, which was in present day Peru.  This photographs depicts many different mummies from the region. There are many examples to show, but I chose this one for the article. It was posted onPinterestand is credited/copyrighted to Reuters/Mariana Bazo. The photo has nothing to do with the Nazca mummy discussed here and is simply used for reference purposes to show mummies from the same time and region.Mummies from the Chachapoyas culture from about 800 AD are displayed at the Museum of Leymebamba, in the Andean region of Chachapoyas, on July 16, 2011. The mummies have been wrapped in layers of cloth, creating a microclimate that promotes conservation, according to the Museum. The skin of the mummies has also been treated and appears leathery with preserved facial features. (Reuters/Mariana Bazo)Although one mummy appears to be a similar, plaster-like appearance, I do believe that this is simply the lighting on the bottom right of the photo. Most (all?) are the normal tan appearance, while others were discovered wrapped.The lack of similar characteristics could be due to sub-cultural differences in embalming methods in the region, but again, I was unable to find any references to show similar looks/appearances of mummies around the same time.The elongated skull is nothing new, or even rare, for the region.The elongated skull has added to the intrigue and the mystique of this find, but it is not rare for the region.  So, let’s just pretend for a moment this is not a hoax, but a genuine find.  The odds of it being “alien” and having similar characteristics to those cultures found in the region, at the same time, is pretty nil.  New species? This doesn’t rule that possibility out – but may be more of a deformity as the explanation, or just a downright hoax.Deliberate deformity of the skull, “peruvian deformity ” Proto-Nazca Culture (from 200 to 100 BC), Region of Nazca Peru. Copyright: Didier DescouensLack of scientific method is hurting the validity of this study.There are many different things you can point out to show a lack of scientific method when handling a mummy that is possibly thousands of years old.  First, let’s take the location. It appears to have been shot outside, in the harsh climate air of Peru/South America, on a rooftop, backyard or patio. See this screen shot:The choice of location to analyze the mummy and collect samples is questionable.As you can see, this is outside, and not in a laboratory setting.Also, let’s revisit this section of video:This frame of video shows the lack of proper equipment. The “table” the mummy sits on, is not much wider than the mummy itself. The dangers posed by this alone, puts the scientific method into question.In this frame of video, you can clearly see the lack of proper equipment.The “table” the mummy sits on, is not much wider than the mummy itself. The dangers posed by this alone, puts the scientific method into question.The lack of detailed information in any of the released material (as of the writing of this critique).There is a big question mark about a discovery, when the one making extraordinary claims can not tell you when, or where, the specimen was discovered. As of the writing of this critique, there has not been a single shred of any evidence, that this was discovered by a reputable (or even a questionable) archaeologist, scientist, historian, librarian, disc jockey, television producer or a paleontologist.  The videos simply skip this information, and go directly into the discovery itself.  To show this was or is a legitimate discovery, there should be more information given to the public about it’s origin.The main player involved.Sadly, we can not get away from the main “promoter” of this discovery, Jaime Maussan.  I have met Jaime many times, and I believe him to be a very nice man, successful and very popular with his audience.  But we can not get away from the controversies that have surrounded his many stories over the years. Here are just a select few HOAXES that were promoted by Jaime Maussan, then kind of brushed under the rug as newer stories appeared.This “Alien” mummy as appearing in the “Roswell Slides” now considered a hoax.This fairy now considered a hoax.This little guy, known as the “Metepec creature” now considered a hoax.This “Alien” photo from 2005 now considered a hoax.There has been a long line of these types of stories that garner worldwide attention, and even gain quite a bit of money from “pay per view” subscriptions, like the Roswell Slides story.  But after the limelight, after the money rolls in, they turn out to be nothing more than a hoax.Since Jaime Maussan is clearly featured in this video — one has to consider this possibility for this story as well.The Team of Scientists is questionable.I am not one to say that  just because a doctor researches fringe topics, they are not reputable.  However, we do have to point out a few things about those featured as part of the research team that take away from the credibility of this story.Dr. Konstantin Korotkov– One of the main voices in the video, is Dr. Konstantin Korotkov. He speaks highly about the scientific importance of the Nazca Mummy, but researching his background, it is unclear why he would be one of the main voices (if a voice at all). All references to Dr. Korotkov, is about his research into Kirlian Photography.  One reference to his work appears on the Wikipedia page for Kirlian photography:“Konstantin Korotkov developed a technique similar to Kirlian photography called “gas discharge visualization” (GDV). Korotkov’s GDV camera system consists of hardware and software to directly record, process and interpret GDV images with a computer. Korotkov’s web site promotes his device and research in a medical context.  Izabela Ciesielska at the Institute of Architecture of Textiles in Poland used Korotkov’s GDV camera to evaluate the effects of human contact with various textiles on biological factors such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as corona discharge images. The experiments captured corona discharge images of subjects fingertips while the subjects wore sleeves of various natural and synthetic materials on their forearms. The results failed to establish a relationship between human contact with the textiles and the corona discharge images and were considered inconclusive.”His background, and realm of main research study, is almost the complete opposite of what he is being interviewed about.  As atelevision producer, when we talk about archaeology in a documentary, we use an archaeologist.  When I talk about astronomy, I use an astronomer.  The use of Dr. Korotkov is very suspect.Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez– Doing a quick Google search on Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez, you discover he is the same one credited as being a part of the “Roswell Slides” research team who worked with Jaime Maussan. His testimony was that the slide depicted an alien, and since that whole story turned out to be a hoax, it does question the validity of this expert as part of this team and makes any conclusions he may draw very suspect.Interested in the story? Be prepared to pay.I will not discount any story because there is a “pay wall” to access it — but you do have to question motive if there is one.  Using the Roswell Slides story as an example, to see the discovery and the “reveal” you needed to sign up, and pay to watch the event in Mexico.  It is unknown how many paid to do just that when the event was broadcast, but it is believed to be well into the tens of thousands.The dissemination of information about Unearthing Nazca, and the mummy in question, is behind a pay-wall to access as well. Meaning, you need to signup as a paying member to GAIA.com to see the story unfold.  But the difference here is it appears to be a running “series” so the information will be spoon-fed to the public.  This approach is admirable as they will reveal the information as it comes in, but it does prolong the necessity to keep your paid  subscription longer. The latter part of this point makes this suspect. Again, this point alone is not a sign of a definite hoax, and I believe they have every right to charge what they wish for access to their site and material.  However, a discovery like this should be written about and chronicled within scientific journals, and IF the discovery is that big, it should be released to the public for the betterment of humanity and our understanding of our place in the history books. But, that is just my way of thinking about such a revelation.There are known, crafted, and artificial mummies being circulated in Peru and South America.On June 24, 2017,Nahuel Monteblanco of Cientificos.pepublished the following article, as translated into English. I was forced to use an online translator, so please forgive any errors during that process. But I believe the information it displays is possible proof that this is a manufactured mummy that is not a true artifact from history, but rather, a mish-mash compilation of bones and tissue made to look real (and even alien) – but is not.Here is the article, as translated:Scam promoting illegal excavations and possible destruction of the national archaeological heritageby Nahuel MonteblancoThis week again the archaeological theme comes to the fore, revealing how far we are from being a country that appreciates the history of the territory it occupies.We have an immense historical legacy, with cultures ranging from Caral to the Inca Empire, a great source of history and knowledge, and well cared for, could also become an immense source of tourism and income.In spite of this potential, we do not have a real system of protection of archaeological remains that works and with the amount of professionals who are in charge of the valorization of these, that study and validate every piece that is discovered.Today we have to bring to light the case of supposedextraterrestrial mummies, that is, bodies of non-human beings found in the Nasca desert, and that have been promoted internationally by people like the Mexican ufologist Jaime Maussan and his team of Collaborators, all of them researchers of paranormal phenomena and extraterrestrial life,none outside that circle.We contacted thePh.D.Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi, in charge of the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Natural History Museum of the UNMSM and associate researcher of the paleontology division of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, whom we ask to inform us more about.Here is the interview with the Ph.D.Salas-Gismondi, who analyzed this case and presents its chronology and conclusions.“First appears a man named Ronceros, who presented the remains through home videos on YouTube saying that they were true aliens.Basically, it presents the remains that are observed in the photos that made us arrive and are observed in the followingvideo.After visiting the Museum – and certain other institutions – and seeing that no one would believe that story, Ronceros changes the script and says that they arerepresentations of aliens(not true aliens) made by pre-Hispanic cultures using bones of animals and people.In this interview Ronceros enters into contradictions and can not support the veracity of the findings, even trying to undermine theMinistry of Culture(video).The mummy of Maussan is different from the one that Ronceros shows, it is a new mummy.My friend, the archaeologist Pedro Vargas Nalvarte, has seen directly the remains that took Ronceros to the Museum and clearly determined that they were false.The newspaper El Trome has published an investigation, related to the specialists who support the alien identity of the mummy.At this moment appears Jaime Maussan – journalist, ufólogo, hunter of ghosts -, who affirms that the mummiesdocorrespond to true aliens.The so-called Ronceros alien mummies are made of bone remains of humans and animals, in most cases mixed.The result is beings of humanoid appearance without any natural anatomical organization because the bones do not correspond between them.The human remains used are apparently archaeological.The Maussan alien mummy is an archaeological mummy with the typical fetal position and known cranial deformation in pre-Hispanic cultures.From the x-rays that can be seen in thevideo, the whole skeleton of this mummy is made up of human bones.Even the feet and hands, which have only three long fingers, are formed of human metaphors and phalanges.The fact that this mummy has only three fingers and that the bones that make up these fingers are exactly the same as those of a human who has five fingers, has no evolutionary sense.If this creature had evolved three fingers, there would be other anatomical changes in the bones of the arms, hands, legs and feet, all these changes associated with the evolution of three fingers.None of this happens in the skeleton.In contrast, they lack the cuboid tarsal bone and apparently the external fingers.This mummy is an archaeological mummy to which two fingers have been removed and the number of phalanges increased to the remaining three fingers.GAIA Update Video 6/30/17On June 30, 2017, Gaia released this update video on their investigation. It is included here for reference.  I have reached out to Gaia, and offered to post ANY / ALL rebuttals to the above points unedited. Although this video addresses a date discrepancy on one of the images used in their video (good catch – but never thought that was an issue, and was never listed above), there are still many unanswered questions.As of the writing of this message, I have not received any request to post any rebuttals or comments.As of July 10, 2017, Gaia has continued to run (non-public) update videos chronicling this story. I am unable to post these, since they are behind a pay-wall, but they are worth a mention as Gaia has released more information on their journey. I just can’t publish them here.Interview with Gaia – Added 7/11/2017On July 10, 2017, I added the below interview (via email) that I conducted with Melissa Tittl, Director of Content Creation, from Gaia.  Let me first say a special thank you to Melissa, and Gaia, for allowing me to ask such skeptical questions. Please note, as I said to Gaia, I felt the overall details of the case and specimen were out there, and I did not want to just repeat what they had already answered, or what could be deduced from the videos.I have a lot of respect to those (and this is directed to Gaia) for those who are not afraid of skeptical questions. So, my special thanks to Melissa for taking the time to address my larger concerns.Here is the interview (I have not edited the interview in any way – and I have included my letter to Melissa, including her responses):Hi Melissa,Thank you for agreeing to speak with me about this. As I mentioned to you privately, and also printed publicly, I am a friend of Gaia, and my skepticism here is simply due to my skepticism on claims like this. I mean no offense by posing some of these questions, but rather, feel some of this is of key concern to many out there, and I appreciate you taking the time to address some of the concerns. I feel that is a strong indicator that Gaia is not afraid of the truth, and will meet skepticism head on.  I appreciate that!I hope you have a chance to read my write-up here:https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/unearthing-nazca-common-sense-approach-analyzing-three-fingered-mummy-peru/I tried to be fair, balanced, and bring up valid points of concerns, which lead to my line of questioning below. For the record, Gaia has already done many interviews about this, most notably withEarthFiles, and I believe much of the substance of the find is found in those interviews. I do not want to waste your time and ask a bunch of repeat questions, so I am going to focus on the larger and more skeptical points which I feel have not been asked or addressed.1)      One of the biggest concerns generated by the video, is the lack of scientific method when handling the mummy. I do not believe this is on the side of Gaia, as I was told the location of filming was dictated to you, rather than chosen, but were you concerned at all about how this specimen was being handled and the location it was handled in? If this truly is a genuine find (like a new missing link in our evolution, or new species, or new whatever) wouldn’t it be in a controlled, laboratory type setting rather than outside in that climate and handled the way it was? Is this a concern?Melissa: You have to understand that we got word of this discovery and we thought ” lets check it out”.  We didn’t actually know what we were going to see. They told us to meet at that location and we did and that is where they brought out the big body. When they pulled it out did look strange. I think all of us were kind of taken back that it looked sort of fake but then other parts of it had real human like components. We just wanted to keep documenting the discovery.  I think it should be in a controlled laboratory.  Again, we didn’t know what we were going to see so on the advice of some of the people in the medical field there at the time we took samples.  We as Gaia were documenting this.  I have called many different organizations to be involved going forward so that we can hand this off to science. It has not happened yet but many people involved are trying to make that happen. The bodies are registered with the ministry of culture in Peru.  They will be giving their thoughts on the matter I am sure soon.  We are just documenting something that could be real, could be a hoax or could be something completely different.  Our job is to find out what it is and we really really want that to be backed up by science.  This might be a network where we have alot of different programming but this is something that is a bit different and we don’t want to speculate what it might be but rather have science depict what it might be.  We are here to give you the story.2)      On the above note, although the specimen may be determined old by Carbon 14 dating, how can we trust any other potential discoveries or anomalies, as they may just be a result of contamination?Melissa: I can’t answer if they could or could not be contaminated.  The team that we documented while we were there was doing the best they could. It’s interesting to note that there are several different samples sent out to labs for carbon dating results and they are coming up with the same date for the big body. I think that is interesting.3)      I was surprised to find that there is a man in South America who has, since as early as late 2016, been trying to “sell” his discovery of a three fingered alien. I learned no scientist took him seriously, so he changed his story, and now says they are fakes, BUT, his twist is they are fakes made by the Nazca people 1800 years ago and they represented the aliens that were seen back then (his wording). That could be interesting, but it appears he is just changing his original story and trying another one.  Surprisingly, his mummies have long, elongated skulls, and three fingers, nearly identical to the mummy in Unearthing Nazca. I tracked down this man (his real name is Luis Quispe), and he says openly your mummy is manufactured (but says that it was made by the Nazca people). He even has YouTube videos on how mummies like this are made.  Is this a concern of yours that he is largely considered a hoaxer and his mummies are nearly identical to the one Gaia has in Unearthing Nazca?  It seems like a strange coincidence…Melissa: His name is Paul … from what I understand.  These items presented here are not what we took samples from and it is not what we were looking at when we were down there. Even those small bodies look different then the ones that we looked at.  However, it is a strange connection.  Could they be all be related in this way? We have to find out. I guess being a journalist i would say the strangest conclusion Paul came up with was ” they are fabricated but a long time ago”  Why?  Again our job is to get to the bottom of all these questions. I know there is a lot of them and we hope to answer them as we get results in and hopefully hand over to science. WE are basically saying we are looking in to it and we will publish the results as we get them.4)      Do you have any indication that this mummy is fabricated, manufactured or “not real” in the sense that although the “mummy parts” could be real and date back 1800 years, the specimen itself could be fabricated?  (I note the videos say no signs of glue – but there other ways to hold together pieces of bone and animal parts.)Melissa: Yes I agree there are other ways to hold together body parts.  We are looking into this as well. I have several phone calls into experts that could possibly explain how this could be done.  This of course is something that hasn’t aired yet but the team at Gaia is looking into not only how it could be real but how it could be fake.  Again, I can’t stress enough our job is to document what we see and not to make conclusions based on assumptions.  No one in our company has said it is real.5)      Many criticize the main person involved in this, Jaime Maussan.  I have known Jaime for many years, and like him as a person, but there is no getting away from the fact that many of his discoveries have been proven fakes. I listed a few on my article, but most notably and recently, the “Roswell Slides” which was, of all things, a mummy.  He was highly criticized for publicizing this as an alien, and made people pay to see the full reveal. It is now considered it was all a fake, and Jaime has apologized on at least one occasion that I have heard.  With this growing list of hoaxes, what is Gaia’s response to that? Is this a concern at all that this list of hoaxes include an alien mummy, alien creature, a fairy and an alien photo?Melissa: Jaime is going to do Jaime.  We happened to hear about this just like he did and we thought it was interesting.  There are alot of interesting characters in this mix.  Its not what people say or what they do its why they do them in the first place.  That is the work of a journalist.  Hopefully , we at Gaia get to the bottom of the scientific results.6)      As indicated in question 5, the Roswell Slides were largely touted as “alien.”  Among those giving that conclusion was  Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez.  So, his inclusion in your video makes his conclusions highly questionable given his involvement with that.  Why should we consider his opinion now as valid?Melissa: I cannot speak about the Roswell slides because I was not involved.  I do know the criticism that team got from the out come and it would seem that same team is at it again. However,  I find what he has to say interesting because some of the structural talk on the bones correlated with what the American radiologist said.  They are talking points based on observation but once again Gaia is documenting this meaning we will take all sides of the story and conversation.  What I would really love is for anthropologists and archaeologists to get involved. I would also like a university to give their opinion with a full forensic diagnostic. I invite that opportunity so our journalistic view of this can go even further.  Pieces like “Unearthing Nazca” are not supposed to make people upset but ask these questions: Who do we trust?  If someone would fabricate this why would they do it?  Why do people keep searching for evidence of ET’s?”  These are all valid.  Keep asking. Lets keep digging.  The only way we can get to the bottom of stories like this is not to dismiss them but ask why they exist at all.  I hope our team can uncover all angles.7)      The white plaster-like appearance to the mummy is unlike any mummy that I have been able to see in museums or online digital archives. Is this a concern for Gaia that although the “insides” date back 1800 years approximately, the sheer appearance of the mummy is unlike any others?  For the record, Luis Quispe that I mentioned above, said the white material was simply clay.Melissa: We got the white powder test results in just yesterday and they are not JUST CLAY. I can’t tell you what they are yet but this is very interesting. Something we hope to get a Paleo-biologist and other forensic specialists on board to look at.I also raise other questions/points in the article, which I welcome your response to. However, the questions above are my “top 7” that I feel are the most critical to address.On behalf of those who have an interest in this story, and want to give it a chance (like me!), THANK YOU for your time, patience and understanding for why the above questions are asked.As promised, I will published any and all responses you’d like to the above (and whatever else), UNEDITED, to my article for my viewers.Do the above answers satisfy your skepticism?  Offer your input below.ConclusionAfter my analysis, and considering all the available evidence thus far, it is MY conclusion that I label this a:PROBABLE HOAXFor the record, however, I do not believe Gaia is the one orchestrating this hoax, but rather, they are documenting the evidence that is put forth to them.  I believe the the root of the hoax, if there is one, stretches back farther time-wise than their involvement.Want to add your two cents?

The story ultimately ended up being a misidentified artifact, or possibly, an outright hoax. You decide which one – but it was NOT alien.Now, only two years after that story broke, another “mummy” has appeared on the internet. This one, a three-fingered mummy, is being publicized by Gaia.com and investigative journalist Jaime Maussan, the same man who happens to be the one who publicized the “Roswell Slides” story above.Please note: Before I get into this critique, let me say I am a friend to the Gaia network. I have appeared multiple times on their shows, and am friends with many of those who are involved with the network. My critique is NOT against Gaia, but rather, against the specimen being investigated. I mean no offense to any of those connected to this project, and offer my critique for those that are interested.  Also note that all images and corresponding photos are used for reference purposes, and the copyright is maintained by their respective owners.According to Gaia.com, their mission statement is the following:Continue scrolling for more...“Travel down a new road with Gaia, a member-supported conscious media company. Join our community of seekers, dreamers, and doers to empower your own evolution of consciousness. Discover over 8,000 ad-free, streaming titles to inspire and encourage curiosity. Everything is waiting for you; which path will you choose?”On June 20, 2017, Gaia released the following promotional trailer on YouTube and multiple social network channels promoting their newest series of videos coming to the online streaming network:Gaia posted a very simple and short description for this video:A new anomalous discovery has been unearthed in Peru. Join Gaia’s ongoing investigation and decide for yourself if this is proof of a non-human species.Within hours, it received hundreds of thousands of hits — and within 5 days — it was viewed more than 20 MILLION views on Facebook alone.  Case in point: the world was watching and they were interested. But is this exactly what it is being portrayed?Let’s start to dissect.In fairness, Gaia is not labeling this new find “alien” but rather, a “New Species” as tagged on their video.  They depict the mummy, with a graphical animation, looking like this:It is this representation which has many to believe, although Gaia is not saying “alien”, they are implying it with the graphic resembling that of a “grey alien” often depicted in alien abduction stories.  In fairness again, “grey aliens” are humanoid in appearance given the many differing descriptions, so Gaia could not have ever escaped that critique by those who wanted to throw the implication.So let’s move on.There are many issues with the Nazca Mummy which have many, including myself, asking a lot of questions.I found many different threads online talking about this story, many different websites touting it as proof of aliens, and even Snopes got into the action by labeling it a hoax — but to my disappointment —Snopeslabeled it a hoax on their page, offering very little actual substance stating WHY it was a hoax.  So, I created this page to offer a much more detailed critique of this story.This page will evolve as the story unfolds so check back often for updates.The ProblemsI think for the sake of this field of study, one must truly look critically at a story, and dissect all the angles before labeling it a hoax. Unlike Snopes, we can’t just label it a hoax simply because evidence has never supported the existence of alien life in the past, like they state on their page:However, no evidence has ever definitively proved the existence of alien life, and countless “alien” discoveries have later been shown to be hoaxes or to have far more mundane explanations.That’s an unfair statement to make, since Snopes themselves acknowledge that Gaia only posed the question of an alien, but never labeled it as such.So, let’s take a look at the red flags (in my book) about this story, that will (hopefully) one day be addressed by Gaia, Jaime Maussan or by any of those involved in this research project.  They are listed here in no particular order.The white plaster-like appearance of the Mummy is unlike others discovered from the same time frame and region.This is one of the biggest red flags, which is often cited by skeptics of this case.  No one can help but see a similarity between a plaster made model, and this mummy.  I began researching mummies found in the same region, from around the same time frame, and can not (at the time of writing this critique) find references that this embalming method was commonplace for the region.   You can see the plaster-like material disintegrate on the small platform as the mummy is handled. (This either supports the substance is very much plaster-like and possibly not an indicator of a real mummy, OR it supports the lack of scientific method used with this artifact, see below for more information on that).You can see that whatever the “outer coating” is of the mummy, it is disintegrating while the mummy is being handled.For reference, I was able to find a shelf full of mummies from the Chachapoyas, which was in present day Peru.  This photographs depicts many different mummies from the region. There are many examples to show, but I chose this one for the article. It was posted onPinterestand is credited/copyrighted to Reuters/Mariana Bazo. The photo has nothing to do with the Nazca mummy discussed here and is simply used for reference purposes to show mummies from the same time and region.Mummies from the Chachapoyas culture from about 800 AD are displayed at the Museum of Leymebamba, in the Andean region of Chachapoyas, on July 16, 2011. The mummies have been wrapped in layers of cloth, creating a microclimate that promotes conservation, according to the Museum. The skin of the mummies has also been treated and appears leathery with preserved facial features. (Reuters/Mariana Bazo)Although one mummy appears to be a similar, plaster-like appearance, I do believe that this is simply the lighting on the bottom right of the photo. Most (all?) are the normal tan appearance, while others were discovered wrapped.The lack of similar characteristics could be due to sub-cultural differences in embalming methods in the region, but again, I was unable to find any references to show similar looks/appearances of mummies around the same time.The elongated skull is nothing new, or even rare, for the region.The elongated skull has added to the intrigue and the mystique of this find, but it is not rare for the region.  So, let’s just pretend for a moment this is not a hoax, but a genuine find.  The odds of it being “alien” and having similar characteristics to those cultures found in the region, at the same time, is pretty nil.  New species? This doesn’t rule that possibility out – but may be more of a deformity as the explanation, or just a downright hoax.Deliberate deformity of the skull, “peruvian deformity ” Proto-Nazca Culture (from 200 to 100 BC), Region of Nazca Peru. Copyright: Didier DescouensLack of scientific method is hurting the validity of this study.There are many different things you can point out to show a lack of scientific method when handling a mummy that is possibly thousands of years old.  First, let’s take the location. It appears to have been shot outside, in the harsh climate air of Peru/South America, on a rooftop, backyard or patio. See this screen shot:The choice of location to analyze the mummy and collect samples is questionable.As you can see, this is outside, and not in a laboratory setting.Also, let’s revisit this section of video:This frame of video shows the lack of proper equipment. The “table” the mummy sits on, is not much wider than the mummy itself. The dangers posed by this alone, puts the scientific method into question.In this frame of video, you can clearly see the lack of proper equipment.The “table” the mummy sits on, is not much wider than the mummy itself. The dangers posed by this alone, puts the scientific method into question.The lack of detailed information in any of the released material (as of the writing of this critique).There is a big question mark about a discovery, when the one making extraordinary claims can not tell you when, or where, the specimen was discovered. As of the writing of this critique, there has not been a single shred of any evidence, that this was discovered by a reputable (or even a questionable) archaeologist, scientist, historian, librarian, disc jockey, television producer or a paleontologist.  The videos simply skip this information, and go directly into the discovery itself.  To show this was or is a legitimate discovery, there should be more information given to the public about it’s origin.The main player involved.Sadly, we can not get away from the main “promoter” of this discovery, Jaime Maussan.  I have met Jaime many times, and I believe him to be a very nice man, successful and very popular with his audience.  But we can not get away from the controversies that have surrounded his many stories over the years. Here are just a select few HOAXES that were promoted by Jaime Maussan, then kind of brushed under the rug as newer stories appeared.This “Alien” mummy as appearing in the “Roswell Slides” now considered a hoax.This fairy now considered a hoax.This little guy, known as the “Metepec creature” now considered a hoax.This “Alien” photo from 2005 now considered a hoax.There has been a long line of these types of stories that garner worldwide attention, and even gain quite a bit of money from “pay per view” subscriptions, like the Roswell Slides story.  But after the limelight, after the money rolls in, they turn out to be nothing more than a hoax.Since Jaime Maussan is clearly featured in this video — one has to consider this possibility for this story as well.The Team of Scientists is questionable.I am not one to say that  just because a doctor researches fringe topics, they are not reputable.  However, we do have to point out a few things about those featured as part of the research team that take away from the credibility of this story.Dr. Konstantin Korotkov– One of the main voices in the video, is Dr. Konstantin Korotkov. He speaks highly about the scientific importance of the Nazca Mummy, but researching his background, it is unclear why he would be one of the main voices (if a voice at all). All references to Dr. Korotkov, is about his research into Kirlian Photography.  One reference to his work appears on the Wikipedia page for Kirlian photography:“Konstantin Korotkov developed a technique similar to Kirlian photography called “gas discharge visualization” (GDV). Korotkov’s GDV camera system consists of hardware and software to directly record, process and interpret GDV images with a computer. Korotkov’s web site promotes his device and research in a medical context.  Izabela Ciesielska at the Institute of Architecture of Textiles in Poland used Korotkov’s GDV camera to evaluate the effects of human contact with various textiles on biological factors such as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as corona discharge images. The experiments captured corona discharge images of subjects fingertips while the subjects wore sleeves of various natural and synthetic materials on their forearms. The results failed to establish a relationship between human contact with the textiles and the corona discharge images and were considered inconclusive.”His background, and realm of main research study, is almost the complete opposite of what he is being interviewed about.  As atelevision producer, when we talk about archaeology in a documentary, we use an archaeologist.  When I talk about astronomy, I use an astronomer.  The use of Dr. Korotkov is very suspect.Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez– Doing a quick Google search on Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez, you discover he is the same one credited as being a part of the “Roswell Slides” research team who worked with Jaime Maussan. His testimony was that the slide depicted an alien, and since that whole story turned out to be a hoax, it does question the validity of this expert as part of this team and makes any conclusions he may draw very suspect.Interested in the story? Be prepared to pay.I will not discount any story because there is a “pay wall” to access it — but you do have to question motive if there is one.  Using the Roswell Slides story as an example, to see the discovery and the “reveal” you needed to sign up, and pay to watch the event in Mexico.  It is unknown how many paid to do just that when the event was broadcast, but it is believed to be well into the tens of thousands.The dissemination of information about Unearthing Nazca, and the mummy in question, is behind a pay-wall to access as well. Meaning, you need to signup as a paying member to GAIA.com to see the story unfold.  But the difference here is it appears to be a running “series” so the information will be spoon-fed to the public.  This approach is admirable as they will reveal the information as it comes in, but it does prolong the necessity to keep your paid  subscription longer. The latter part of this point makes this suspect. Again, this point alone is not a sign of a definite hoax, and I believe they have every right to charge what they wish for access to their site and material.  However, a discovery like this should be written about and chronicled within scientific journals, and IF the discovery is that big, it should be released to the public for the betterment of humanity and our understanding of our place in the history books. But, that is just my way of thinking about such a revelation.There are known, crafted, and artificial mummies being circulated in Peru and South America.On June 24, 2017,Nahuel Monteblanco of Cientificos.pepublished the following article, as translated into English. I was forced to use an online translator, so please forgive any errors during that process. But I believe the information it displays is possible proof that this is a manufactured mummy that is not a true artifact from history, but rather, a mish-mash compilation of bones and tissue made to look real (and even alien) – but is not.Here is the article, as translated:Scam promoting illegal excavations and possible destruction of the national archaeological heritageby Nahuel MonteblancoThis week again the archaeological theme comes to the fore, revealing how far we are from being a country that appreciates the history of the territory it occupies.We have an immense historical legacy, with cultures ranging from Caral to the Inca Empire, a great source of history and knowledge, and well cared for, could also become an immense source of tourism and income.In spite of this potential, we do not have a real system of protection of archaeological remains that works and with the amount of professionals who are in charge of the valorization of these, that study and validate every piece that is discovered.Today we have to bring to light the case of supposedextraterrestrial mummies, that is, bodies of non-human beings found in the Nasca desert, and that have been promoted internationally by people like the Mexican ufologist Jaime Maussan and his team of Collaborators, all of them researchers of paranormal phenomena and extraterrestrial life,none outside that circle.We contacted thePh.D.Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi, in charge of the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Natural History Museum of the UNMSM and associate researcher of the paleontology division of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, whom we ask to inform us more about.Here is the interview with the Ph.D.Salas-Gismondi, who analyzed this case and presents its chronology and conclusions.“First appears a man named Ronceros, who presented the remains through home videos on YouTube saying that they were true aliens.Basically, it presents the remains that are observed in the photos that made us arrive and are observed in the followingvideo.After visiting the Museum – and certain other institutions – and seeing that no one would believe that story, Ronceros changes the script and says that they arerepresentations of aliens(not true aliens) made by pre-Hispanic cultures using bones of animals and people.In this interview Ronceros enters into contradictions and can not support the veracity of the findings, even trying to undermine theMinistry of Culture(video).The mummy of Maussan is different from the one that Ronceros shows, it is a new mummy.My friend, the archaeologist Pedro Vargas Nalvarte, has seen directly the remains that took Ronceros to the Museum and clearly determined that they were false.The newspaper El Trome has published an investigation, related to the specialists who support the alien identity of the mummy.At this moment appears Jaime Maussan – journalist, ufólogo, hunter of ghosts -, who affirms that the mummiesdocorrespond to true aliens.The so-called Ronceros alien mummies are made of bone remains of humans and animals, in most cases mixed.The result is beings of humanoid appearance without any natural anatomical organization because the bones do not correspond between them.The human remains used are apparently archaeological.The Maussan alien mummy is an archaeological mummy with the typical fetal position and known cranial deformation in pre-Hispanic cultures.From the x-rays that can be seen in thevideo, the whole skeleton of this mummy is made up of human bones.Even the feet and hands, which have only three long fingers, are formed of human metaphors and phalanges.The fact that this mummy has only three fingers and that the bones that make up these fingers are exactly the same as those of a human who has five fingers, has no evolutionary sense.If this creature had evolved three fingers, there would be other anatomical changes in the bones of the arms, hands, legs and feet, all these changes associated with the evolution of three fingers.None of this happens in the skeleton.In contrast, they lack the cuboid tarsal bone and apparently the external fingers.This mummy is an archaeological mummy to which two fingers have been removed and the number of phalanges increased to the remaining three fingers.GAIA Update Video 6/30/17On June 30, 2017, Gaia released this update video on their investigation. It is included here for reference.  I have reached out to Gaia, and offered to post ANY / ALL rebuttals to the above points unedited. Although this video addresses a date discrepancy on one of the images used in their video (good catch – but never thought that was an issue, and was never listed above), there are still many unanswered questions.As of the writing of this message, I have not received any request to post any rebuttals or comments.As of July 10, 2017, Gaia has continued to run (non-public) update videos chronicling this story. I am unable to post these, since they are behind a pay-wall, but they are worth a mention as Gaia has released more information on their journey. I just can’t publish them here.Interview with Gaia – Added 7/11/2017On July 10, 2017, I added the below interview (via email) that I conducted with Melissa Tittl, Director of Content Creation, from Gaia.  Let me first say a special thank you to Melissa, and Gaia, for allowing me to ask such skeptical questions. Please note, as I said to Gaia, I felt the overall details of the case and specimen were out there, and I did not want to just repeat what they had already answered, or what could be deduced from the videos.I have a lot of respect to those (and this is directed to Gaia) for those who are not afraid of skeptical questions. So, my special thanks to Melissa for taking the time to address my larger concerns.Here is the interview (I have not edited the interview in any way – and I have included my letter to Melissa, including her responses):Hi Melissa,Thank you for agreeing to speak with me about this. As I mentioned to you privately, and also printed publicly, I am a friend of Gaia, and my skepticism here is simply due to my skepticism on claims like this. I mean no offense by posing some of these questions, but rather, feel some of this is of key concern to many out there, and I appreciate you taking the time to address some of the concerns. I feel that is a strong indicator that Gaia is not afraid of the truth, and will meet skepticism head on.  I appreciate that!I hope you have a chance to read my write-up here:https://www.theblackvault.com/casefiles/unearthing-nazca-common-sense-approach-analyzing-three-fingered-mummy-peru/I tried to be fair, balanced, and bring up valid points of concerns, which lead to my line of questioning below. For the record, Gaia has already done many interviews about this, most notably withEarthFiles, and I believe much of the substance of the find is found in those interviews. I do not want to waste your time and ask a bunch of repeat questions, so I am going to focus on the larger and more skeptical points which I feel have not been asked or addressed.1)      One of the biggest concerns generated by the video, is the lack of scientific method when handling the mummy. I do not believe this is on the side of Gaia, as I was told the location of filming was dictated to you, rather than chosen, but were you concerned at all about how this specimen was being handled and the location it was handled in? If this truly is a genuine find (like a new missing link in our evolution, or new species, or new whatever) wouldn’t it be in a controlled, laboratory type setting rather than outside in that climate and handled the way it was? Is this a concern?Melissa: You have to understand that we got word of this discovery and we thought ” lets check it out”.  We didn’t actually know what we were going to see. They told us to meet at that location and we did and that is where they brought out the big body. When they pulled it out did look strange. I think all of us were kind of taken back that it looked sort of fake but then other parts of it had real human like components. We just wanted to keep documenting the discovery.  I think it should be in a controlled laboratory.  Again, we didn’t know what we were going to see so on the advice of some of the people in the medical field there at the time we took samples.  We as Gaia were documenting this.  I have called many different organizations to be involved going forward so that we can hand this off to science. It has not happened yet but many people involved are trying to make that happen. The bodies are registered with the ministry of culture in Peru.  They will be giving their thoughts on the matter I am sure soon.  We are just documenting something that could be real, could be a hoax or could be something completely different.  Our job is to find out what it is and we really really want that to be backed up by science.  This might be a network where we have alot of different programming but this is something that is a bit different and we don’t want to speculate what it might be but rather have science depict what it might be.  We are here to give you the story.2)      On the above note, although the specimen may be determined old by Carbon 14 dating, how can we trust any other potential discoveries or anomalies, as they may just be a result of contamination?Melissa: I can’t answer if they could or could not be contaminated.  The team that we documented while we were there was doing the best they could. It’s interesting to note that there are several different samples sent out to labs for carbon dating results and they are coming up with the same date for the big body. I think that is interesting.3)      I was surprised to find that there is a man in South America who has, since as early as late 2016, been trying to “sell” his discovery of a three fingered alien. I learned no scientist took him seriously, so he changed his story, and now says they are fakes, BUT, his twist is they are fakes made by the Nazca people 1800 years ago and they represented the aliens that were seen back then (his wording). That could be interesting, but it appears he is just changing his original story and trying another one.  Surprisingly, his mummies have long, elongated skulls, and three fingers, nearly identical to the mummy in Unearthing Nazca. I tracked down this man (his real name is Luis Quispe), and he says openly your mummy is manufactured (but says that it was made by the Nazca people). He even has YouTube videos on how mummies like this are made.  Is this a concern of yours that he is largely considered a hoaxer and his mummies are nearly identical to the one Gaia has in Unearthing Nazca?  It seems like a strange coincidence…Melissa: His name is Paul … from what I understand.  These items presented here are not what we took samples from and it is not what we were looking at when we were down there. Even those small bodies look different then the ones that we looked at.  However, it is a strange connection.  Could they be all be related in this way? We have to find out. I guess being a journalist i would say the strangest conclusion Paul came up with was ” they are fabricated but a long time ago”  Why?  Again our job is to get to the bottom of all these questions. I know there is a lot of them and we hope to answer them as we get results in and hopefully hand over to science. WE are basically saying we are looking in to it and we will publish the results as we get them.4)      Do you have any indication that this mummy is fabricated, manufactured or “not real” in the sense that although the “mummy parts” could be real and date back 1800 years, the specimen itself could be fabricated?  (I note the videos say no signs of glue – but there other ways to hold together pieces of bone and animal parts.)Melissa: Yes I agree there are other ways to hold together body parts.  We are looking into this as well. I have several phone calls into experts that could possibly explain how this could be done.  This of course is something that hasn’t aired yet but the team at Gaia is looking into not only how it could be real but how it could be fake.  Again, I can’t stress enough our job is to document what we see and not to make conclusions based on assumptions.  No one in our company has said it is real.5)      Many criticize the main person involved in this, Jaime Maussan.  I have known Jaime for many years, and like him as a person, but there is no getting away from the fact that many of his discoveries have been proven fakes. I listed a few on my article, but most notably and recently, the “Roswell Slides” which was, of all things, a mummy.  He was highly criticized for publicizing this as an alien, and made people pay to see the full reveal. It is now considered it was all a fake, and Jaime has apologized on at least one occasion that I have heard.  With this growing list of hoaxes, what is Gaia’s response to that? Is this a concern at all that this list of hoaxes include an alien mummy, alien creature, a fairy and an alien photo?Melissa: Jaime is going to do Jaime.  We happened to hear about this just like he did and we thought it was interesting.  There are alot of interesting characters in this mix.  Its not what people say or what they do its why they do them in the first place.  That is the work of a journalist.  Hopefully , we at Gaia get to the bottom of the scientific results.6)      As indicated in question 5, the Roswell Slides were largely touted as “alien.”  Among those giving that conclusion was  Dr. José de Jesús Zalce Benítez.  So, his inclusion in your video makes his conclusions highly questionable given his involvement with that.  Why should we consider his opinion now as valid?Melissa: I cannot speak about the Roswell slides because I was not involved.  I do know the criticism that team got from the out come and it would seem that same team is at it again. However,  I find what he has to say interesting because some of the structural talk on the bones correlated with what the American radiologist said.  They are talking points based on observation but once again Gaia is documenting this meaning we will take all sides of the story and conversation.  What I would really love is for anthropologists and archaeologists to get involved. I would also like a university to give their opinion with a full forensic diagnostic. I invite that opportunity so our journalistic view of this can go even further.  Pieces like “Unearthing Nazca” are not supposed to make people upset but ask these questions: Who do we trust?  If someone would fabricate this why would they do it?  Why do people keep searching for evidence of ET’s?”  These are all valid.  Keep asking. Lets keep digging.  The only way we can get to the bottom of stories like this is not to dismiss them but ask why they exist at all.  I hope our team can uncover all angles.7)      The white plaster-like appearance to the mummy is unlike any mummy that I have been able to see in museums or online digital archives. Is this a concern for Gaia that although the “insides” date back 1800 years approximately, the sheer appearance of the mummy is unlike any others?  For the record, Luis Quispe that I mentioned above, said the white material was simply clay.Melissa: We got the white powder test results in just yesterday and they are not JUST CLAY. I can’t tell you what they are yet but this is very interesting. Something we hope to get a Paleo-biologist and other forensic specialists on board to look at.I also raise other questions/points in the article, which I welcome your response to. However, the questions above are my “top 7” that I feel are the most critical to address.On behalf of those who have an interest in this story, and want to give it a chance (like me!), THANK YOU for your time, patience and understanding for why the above questions are asked.As promised, I will published any and all responses you’d like to the above (and whatever else), UNEDITED, to my article for my viewers.Do the above answers satisfy your skepticism?  Offer your input below.ConclusionAfter my analysis, and considering all the available evidence thus far, it is MY conclusion that I label this a:PROBABLE HOAXFor the record, however, I do not believe Gaia is the one orchestrating this hoax, but rather, they are documenting the evidence that is put forth to them.  I believe the the root of the hoax, if there is one, stretches back farther time-wise than their involvement.Want to add your two cents?

    "content": "Case File Status: UnexplainedBackgroundby Rob Mercer, TBV InvestigationsThe night sky at the time of this sighting, according to Stellarium.The witness reported that while out observing and photographing the moon and several planets on November 4, 2016 at her home at approximately 7:20 pm, she noticed 2 bright red objects coming from the west in the southern sky.  Both objects were unwavering and flew in a controlled fashion while staying in a vertical position. The diameter of the objects appeared to be slightly larger than an aspirin held at arm’s length. Distance was hard to judge since the event to place with the sky as a backdrop. Due to the size of the objects, she assumed they were close.  Soon after, the witness noticed a large area of the sky in the same direction light up with multiple “flashing and blinking” lights, lasting several minutes. Part of the event captured on camera.The event took place in Lewis Center, Ohio, approximately 20 miles north of Columbus and 12 miles from Port Columbus. Population 26,130, elevation 864’. The area in the direction of the sighting is mostly rural with small hills.The temperature at the time was 51 degrees fahrenheit, the skies were clear, and the wind was north at 4 mph.Continue scrolling for more...The website Stellarium showed the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Saturn all bright and visible in the south-southwestern sky. No satellites were visible.The EvidenceThe following videos were submitted to TBV Investigations by the witness.  The editing was also done by the witness.  It is noted that some of the text frames are very fast, and may need to be seen twice to fully read.Original video with analysis by the witness:Additional video slowed down:The AnalysisThe report was received over a year after the event took place. Searches were done by myself for correlating cases and other related reports that may have been shared, with nothing found. The witness is well educated, and as you will see in the following detailed report submitted by her, did an in-depth investigation herself before reporting it. She is an amateur astronomer and is well familiar with aircraft and their characteristics.It is advised to watch the videos with lights off for more detail.Witness TestimonyThe following was submitted to TBV Investigations from the witness. It is published here unedited:Daytime view of the location of the sighting.“The sighting, November 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm EST to the south of my house. It began while I was standing in my back yard photographing astronomical objects. Thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain UFOs, because when it happened I was photographing Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the Moon and I labeled them on some of the photographs. I am an amateur astronomer, have worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, I had two cameras with me. The cameras were an iPhone 6s and a HiDef Camcorder that also records sound. I have made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. Everything I saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.The location is a family farm where I was born, lived for many years, gone out nearly every night after dark to check things, taken many photos and videos at this location, and have never seen anything like this.It started when I was looking southwest at Venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. They flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. There were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. The object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. The movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. From this first second of the sighting, I was mystified.They approached Venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, I thought they had to be connected. I watched for what would happen when they would pass Venus. They were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. When they went by Venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full Moon’s apparent diameter above Venus and the lower one about the same distance below Venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with Venus in the middle. They moved so synchronously that I expected them to be connected. Although I couldn’t see any connection, I thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.But when they passed by Venus, I saw no dimming, so I didn’t know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past Venus). They didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. They looked nothing like Chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.They flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. I don’t know how they flew–I didn’t hear engine noises, but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. I was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. Also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, I thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. I don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.I had been taking photos of the planets with my iPhone in hand when I saw them. But I was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that I didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. When my brain finally re-activated, I realized I needed to take photos, so I took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 EST each 5 seconds after the previous one. This was after the red objects had already passed. I think I didn’t see anything when I took these photos.Then I noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. This display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. It spread from the tree to my southeast to west of Venus, which was to my west.Because the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, I ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion. It took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. It was mounted on a tripod. By the time, I had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so I couldn’t see them. I thought the tail end of the objects was still there. I pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. When I had seen them with my eyes they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. All this was soundless. There seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. These were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. I took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).The size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. A low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at John Glenn Columbus International Airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the Moon or smaller. The size of the Moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. Another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. It shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. The car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. If the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.There was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. This is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around. The neighbors are my relatives and I know what they are doing. I am very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.These objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. The sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–I have a drone, fly it, photograph with it, and repair it, so I am familiar with drones. The objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). What I saw were bodies against the sky. It was nothing like fireworks. I have recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. This was nothing like Chinese lanterns–several Chinese lanterns have landed in the field I filmed in and I have them. They weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. I saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. I read that all aircraft built after March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. There was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. In addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking.The white flashing objects were nothing like stars. When one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. But they do not completely disappear, and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. The stars and planets have stable locations. Thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. Both cameras can photograph stars at night. Also I have seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. I have also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–I may even have one that I collected here years ago. These last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.The camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when I rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.I’m not sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. The objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane.The objects I watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, I had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. In the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what I captured of these were flashes. Occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.After I recorded the views, I brought the IPhone and camcorder into the house and e-mailed the camera photos to my computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. I still have the original e-mails and camcorder tape. There was a game going on at the school several miles to the west, so I contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. The answer was no, and I didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway. Later I called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. They said no, and suggested calling the Bigelow organization that collects UFO information. I think I called them twice and left a message. They returned the call several days later, but I didn’t get back to them. I immediately on November 4 posted the video both on YouTube and Facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but I didn’t find out anything. The original November 4 YouTube videos and other posts are still on.I also checked the weatherWind Speed 4 mph (North)Max Wind Speed 14 mphMax Gust Speed 17 mphVisibility 8 miles and from the North at 7: 51”The wind was blowing from north to south. The objects traveled from west to east. If the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. Instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. Thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power.Because this was my backyard, I have taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. For example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. These other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.Immediately after I made the photography, I wondered if I had photographed anything, because this was difficult photography. It was dark, which made it difficult to use the iPhone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. But when I uploaded everything to the computer, I was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus.I had taken three photos by iPhone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. These three turned out well and although I thought I had photographed nothing because I did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and I didn’t see anything when I took the photographs, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera.The videotape also turned out much better than I expected. I might have seen a few flashes when I made the video, but the actual video showed much more. When I clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. I had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashesWhen I uploaded the three photographs into the computer, I noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. They were generally to the east of Venus. Although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).In order to check whether the spots were in the same place, I made computer transparencies and overlaid them. This showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. Thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.In order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, I looked at the photos that were taken right before I saw the two red objects. There were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. Thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. They also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.With this camera, I can easily photograph such objects as Mars and Saturn and have even photographed dimmer objects such as Neptune and asteroids, so I’m familiar with the camera’s performance. The stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. I saw no airplanes at the time I took the photographs and I would have noticed them because I was looking at Venus. Moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and I would definitely have noticed. The only things I had seen near Venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before I took the photographs. Also, I doubt if my camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. The objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as Mars. The trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. In addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.Although the only objects I saw were the two red ones, it appeared that I had photographed several other things. Because I had seen the red objects with my eyes, I thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. I think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots I photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.Thus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after I saw the two red ones. I didn’t see these when I took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.These spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as Mars had photographed. I think if I had photographed birds, they have appeared dark. Thus, I thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.I quit photographing with the iPhone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and I ran to the video camera. This also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects I had seen before this were the two red ones. Also, all I saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; I assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. Thus, perhaps the spots I saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed Venus.This photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but I may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. Immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. Thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.Perhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that UFOs will suddenly blink out or disappear.I was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. I was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.The video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. It also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer onesThe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. These were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have other colors that just didn’t photograph). These objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. The first two red objects that I had seen with my eyes shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. Two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. However, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing.The white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (The photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. The neighbors were relatives, and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).I had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. Although I didn’t see this with my eyes when I took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. I don’t know if these red objects were the same ones I saw with my eyes at the beginning when they passed Venus. There were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and I don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. I had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in my original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what I was seeing in the video. Sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. Many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. I don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. I had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).The video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. I don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two I saw with my eyes (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed Venus). These were not vertical as the ones I saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. These two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. Sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. The two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. If these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.I saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.At other times, I would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. I couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. Sometimes I would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. I also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. There seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. I don’t know if there were other colors.The red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. In airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. The first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. And the time between views was less for the last one also. The distance between the red objects varied. Thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft.Other oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. Nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. Their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. Also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. They might have been traveling upward after they had passed me at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. If aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. These appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. And if these were the lighting on a craft, I should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. But I didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times.In comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did.These were nothing like strobe lights. Although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. There was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. In comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. These white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. Their strobing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.There were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. I don’t remember from seeing them with my eyes if there were other colors. In general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly.No object’s flashes were recorded in the same exact place, so I photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. I think I taped only one blink twice in almost the same location.There was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. In several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. The planets never appeared as double. Some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. Sometimes UFOs are reported as merging or coming apart. These double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.There were several indications that these objects had some form of power. One reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. The ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. Also, they glowed, and this glowing would take power. In addition, they were able to blink off and on. Blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. The ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects.During the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. The first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. Venus and the Moon are a distance apart. Venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). A number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.Because this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. For example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full Moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. A close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the Moon. The display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the Moon.These object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. I took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. Thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. The background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. The objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches.Because the background isn’t white, I think most of the white flashes are from objects. Unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. The red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. However, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. An instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. At 00.08 – – 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. Then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. But as they continued, they became less well defined. At 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. On their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. Then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. Perhaps they had sped off.The white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. They often would appear for only one click. Because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen.The bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. However, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. Although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. If these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (When I had first seen the display it was to the west of Venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time I had the camcorder on, I was just photographing the tail end of the group. When I took the video, I thought it might be too late to get anything, but I did photograph some of it.) Thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. I have many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.I disregarded the area at the bottom of the video, near the line of the tree silhouettes, when looking for object’s flashes, because there was some background lighting, which might have caused some form of photographic artifacts.The video began with a wide-angle exposure. A white light appeared at 00:00 – -00.25. It was below the Moon and to the left of Venus. Because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the Moon, Venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance.Two (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 – -00:23, then more flashes appeared. Increased activity begins at about 00:07. One of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 – -00:17, another was at (00:08 – -00.07), and another at 00:015– -00:10. These may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed. One white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 – -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at 00:16 – -00.09). At 00:11 – -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together.At 00:13 – -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. Nothing was visible during further clicks. One trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 – -00.06.The first two red objects appeared at 00:07 – -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at (still at 00:07 – -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 – -00.18). After that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 – -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 – -00.17). The two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 – -00.16. Sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 – – 00.16. At 00:08 – -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. Because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. Sometimes they would form a triangle.Both white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 – -00.22.These red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and I don’t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. Some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. When I am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, I see no flashing objects like this, so they weren’t camera artifacts. The main time there are camera artifacts on this camera’s videos is when the battery is low. These artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. They aren’t flashing objects like these. I just watched the video portions that were above the tree line at the bottom. There may have been artifacts along the tree silhouettes and higher because of background lighting.I posted this video on YouTube on that day and have posted more several more times. Because one could see a lot less on YouTube than on the HiDef video, I just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view: https://youtu.be/P1Cge5TpIyc. I also tried adding a HiDef video, but the YouTube ones didn’t have enough pixels to show much and I received no comments.I think my iPhone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when I took the photos and the photos were in full high definition.The camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. It was a Sony HDR-HC5 HDV 1080 4MP MiniDV Hi with 10x Optical Zoom and digital zoom. The recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on DV cassette tape. The camera has night vision, but I had it set for day vision, so I could see the color of the planets. The video was transferred to an iMac computer using iMovie. The video is large, 425 MB, and I do not know how to send it. The YouTube video upload shows much less than the actual video.I have the original photographs that I sent from my iPhone to my computer and the tracking information. I think I had GPS turned off, but the coordinates were latitude: 40.174204, and longitude – 82.964062. I also have the original videotape. My camera taped over the video, but I had downloaded it before this happened, and I have heard also that an original video can be retrieved even if something is taped over it.A second reason I have not yet reported the sighting was that I had the photos on my iPhone, but then purchased a new iPhone. The technician assured me that everything would transfer from the old phone to the new one. But later I discovered that everything had transferred except these three UFO photos and several before. I felt terrible because I thought I couldn’t verify the photos. But I just (2017.10.11) found out about EXIF data and tried this with the photographs. This worked, and I was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:I used the Internet program camerasummary.com to extract the EXIF information and that for the first iPhone photograph is: “The image on the left is your original image and the image on the right is the thumbnail stored within the image file.

However, another portion of the photographs (not the UFO ones) did transfer from my old iPhone to the new one and these are still on my iPhone.Several people looked at the photography. One person wanted something else called the raw data on the iPhone photos. I looked for this, but it was lost during the transfer because the three UFO photos did not transfer. Since everything on the old phone was transferred at once (not separately) by an electronic process, it is strange (and very irritating) that just the UFO photos didn’t transfer. It might be interesting to try to investigate this; I still have the receipt for the new phone.”ConclusionAt this time, I am unable to determine what the witness saw that evening, and for now, it remains tagged as “Unidentified.”codepeople-post-map require JavaScriptFollow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave",

    "all_content": "Case File Status: UnexplainedBackgroundby Rob Mercer, TBV InvestigationsThe night sky at the time of this sighting, according to Stellarium.The witness reported that while out observing and photographing the moon and several planets on November 4, 2016 at her home at approximately 7:20 pm, she noticed 2 bright red objects coming from the west in the southern sky.  Both objects were unwavering and flew in a controlled fashion while staying in a vertical position. The diameter of the objects appeared to be slightly larger than an aspirin held at arm’s length. Distance was hard to judge since the event to place with the sky as a backdrop. Due to the size of the objects, she assumed they were close.  Soon after, the witness noticed a large area of the sky in the same direction light up with multiple “flashing and blinking” lights, lasting several minutes. Part of the event captured on camera.The event took place in Lewis Center, Ohio, approximately 20 miles north of Columbus and 12 miles from Port Columbus. Population 26,130, elevation 864’. The area in the direction of the sighting is mostly rural with small hills.The temperature at the time was 51 degrees fahrenheit, the skies were clear, and the wind was north at 4 mph.Continue scrolling for more...The website Stellarium showed the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Saturn all bright and visible in the south-southwestern sky. No satellites were visible.The EvidenceThe following videos were submitted to TBV Investigations by the witness.  The editing was also done by the witness.  It is noted that some of the text frames are very fast, and may need to be seen twice to fully read.Original video with analysis by the witness:Additional video slowed down:The AnalysisThe report was received over a year after the event took place. Searches were done by myself for correlating cases and other related reports that may have been shared, with nothing found. The witness is well educated, and as you will see in the following detailed report submitted by her, did an in-depth investigation herself before reporting it. She is an amateur astronomer and is well familiar with aircraft and their characteristics.It is advised to watch the videos with lights off for more detail.Witness TestimonyThe following was submitted to TBV Investigations from the witness. It is published here unedited:Daytime view of the location of the sighting.“The sighting, November 4, 2016, took place at approximately 7:22-7:26 pm EST to the south of my house. It began while I was standing in my back yard photographing astronomical objects. Thus, it was not some mistaken astronomical object as is often used to explain UFOs, because when it happened I was photographing Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the Moon and I labeled them on some of the photographs. I am an amateur astronomer, have worked professionally in photography, and because it was a clear night for good photography and several planets were visible at once, I had two cameras with me. The cameras were an iPhone 6s and a HiDef Camcorder that also records sound. I have made much wildlife, astronomical, and aircraft photography from this location and am very familiar with it. Everything I saw was against the sky, nothing was against background trees or anything.The location is a family farm where I was born, lived for many years, gone out nearly every night after dark to check things, taken many photos and videos at this location, and have never seen anything like this.It started when I was looking southwest at Venus and then saw two bright red glowing objects approaching from the west. They flew smoothly, were completely vertical in orientation to each other, were soundless, and there was no evidence of an airplane or aircraft lights. There were no strobe lights, green lights, sounds, or anything vaguely like an airplane. The object’s lights didn’t blink or change in intensity or brightness. The movements were in complete synchrony, and the objects looked exactly alike. From this first second of the sighting, I was mystified.They approached Venus and because they stayed together so smoothly and completely, I thought they had to be connected. I watched for what would happen when they would pass Venus. They were in a position of one precisely above the other in a straight vertical line. When they went by Venus, it appeared that the top one was about a full Moon’s apparent diameter above Venus and the lower one about the same distance below Venus–the angular distance between the two was about a degree or more with Venus in the middle. They moved so synchronously that I expected them to be connected. Although I couldn’t see any connection, I thought they might be connected to each other by something thin in a barbell-like fashion.But when they passed by Venus, I saw no dimming, so I didn’t know whether they could have been two objects moving in exact synchrony or whether they were like barbells and connected by a thin strand (that wouldn’t show up much when they flew past Venus). They didn’t even slightly sway in the wind and just moved smoothly and steadily together. They looked nothing like Chinese lanterns or any type of balloon.They flew in a controlled fashion–they stayed in a vertical position. I don’t know how they flew–I didn’t hear engine noises, but they must have had some kind of power because they were red and glowing. I was amazed because they looked like something that couldn’t happen-like one would see in a cartoon or a computer simulation. Also because they took up such a large degree of arc, probably a degree or more, I thought they might have been close or of a huge object and expected a sound, but there was none. I don’t know their altitude, but they showed against the sky, not the background.I had been taking photos of the planets with my iPhone in hand when I saw them. But I was so completely dumbfounded in amazement at first that I didn’t do anything except stand there frozen. When my brain finally re-activated, I realized I needed to take photos, so I took pictures–snapped three photos in very rapid succession at 7:22 EST each 5 seconds after the previous one. This was after the red objects had already passed. I think I didn’t see anything when I took these photos.Then I noticed a huge area of the sky light up with all kinds of blinking, gyrating, dancing, flashing objects. This display took up a large area of the sky–maybe 20-30 degrees in width and height. It spread from the tree to my southeast to west of Venus, which was to my west.Because the objects in this display were flashing and seemed to be moving around, I ran for the video camera to try to capture this motion. It took some time to run to the camcorder set it up, get it turned on in the dark, and wait for it to come on. It was mounted on a tripod. By the time, I had the camcorder going, most of the objects had flown behind a tree and a building to the east so I couldn’t see them. I thought the tail end of the objects was still there. I pointed the camcorder and tried to videotape the dancing objects. When I had seen them with my eyes they appeared to flash, move around–sometimes synchronously, blink, etc. All this was soundless. There seemed to have been a number of red and other objects that constantly changed configuration. These were definitely not like any standard aircraft lights. I took a 26-second video (although that doesn’t seem like much you can do a lot with it using a computer).The size of this display of the group of objects was many, many times to large to be the lighting on an aircraft. A low aircraft (such as ones coming in for a landing at John Glenn Columbus International Airport–about 20 miles away) might to be about the apparent angular size of the Moon or smaller. The size of the Moon when compared to size of the display of the group of objects in the video images was very much smaller. Another estimation of the apparent size scale can be found at the end of a video. It shows the length of a car on the road in a wide-angle view. The car is approximately 0.13 mile away, but the length of the car is many times shorter than the display of the group of objects. If the group of objects had been the lighting on an airplane, the airplane would have been either tremendously large or so close it would be almost crashing into the camera.There was nothing there that would cause a group of objects to appear. This is a large family farm area surrounded by agricultural fields with no one around. The neighbors are my relatives and I know what they are doing. I am very used to seeing airplanes, blimps, blimps with lighted sides, and all kinds of aircraft here and photographing them in the dark.These objects seemed nothing like airplane lights or other commonly photographed objects. The sighting was nothing like viewing a drone–I have a drone, fly it, photograph with it, and repair it, so I am familiar with drones. The objects were nothing like lasers or flashlights, because these need something to reflect against to be seen (such as cats chasing a laser on a wall). What I saw were bodies against the sky. It was nothing like fireworks. I have recorded fireworks from this general position using this camera and they look nothing like this. This was nothing like Chinese lanterns–several Chinese lanterns have landed in the field I filmed in and I have them. They weren’t birds, because some glowed red, they blinked on and off, there was no wing motion, and birds don’t light up at night. I saw no green lights at all any time during the sighting and it is standard for aircraft to have green lights. I read that all aircraft built after March 1996 must have an anti-collision light system (strobe lights) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. There was no continuous track of strobe lights as is seen with an aircraft–just white flashes at random all over the sky. In addition, aircraft show a patterned sequence of flashing their lights and there was no form of pattern with these object’s blinking.The white flashing objects were nothing like stars. When one looks at the sky, one can see stars and they often twinkle. But they do not completely disappear, and new stars do not appear in different places as they did in the video. The stars and planets have stable locations. Thus, the phenomenon wasn’t photographs of stars or twinkling. Both cameras can photograph stars at night. Also I have seen meteor showers and northern lights and this sighting resembled neither. I have also seen flares such as airplanes sometimes send out–I may even have one that I collected here years ago. These last longer than a split second and they travel downward, not in all directions.The camcorder records sound very well, but there was no sound except for when I rustled the grass, fiddled with the camera, and from the road traffic.I’m not sure about the colors–whether they were just red and white or whether there were more colors. The objects blinked in random patterns–nothing like an airplane.The objects I watched by eye seemed to dart, dance, and gyrate, and because of that and the flashing, I had gone to the video camera to photograph the motion. In the video, the white objects seemed to just give very quick flashes and it appeared that what I captured of these were flashes. Occasionally, there appeared to be double white lights.After I recorded the views, I brought the IPhone and camcorder into the house and e-mailed the camera photos to my computer, and downloaded the camcorder video tape recording in to the computer. I still have the original e-mails and camcorder tape. There was a game going on at the school several miles to the west, so I contacted someone there to see if anything had been released. The answer was no, and I didn’t think so to begin with but checked anyway. Later I called the airport to see if anything unusual had been flying here or if anyone had seen anything. They said no, and suggested calling the Bigelow organization that collects UFO information. I think I called them twice and left a message. They returned the call several days later, but I didn’t get back to them. I immediately on November 4 posted the video both on YouTube and Facebook and also did the next day in order to find out if anyone else had seen or knew anything, but I didn’t find out anything. The original November 4 YouTube videos and other posts are still on.I also checked the weatherWind Speed 4 mph (North)Max Wind Speed 14 mphMax Gust Speed 17 mphVisibility 8 miles and from the North at 7: 51”The wind was blowing from north to south. The objects traveled from west to east. If the wind were coming from the north, the group of objects would have been blown to the south and stayed in view if they had continued to be lit. Instead, the group flew behind the tree and building to the east and quickly disappeared. Thus, because they were not flying in the direction the wind would have blown them, they may have been operating under some form of power.Because this was my backyard, I have taken many other videos in the same area, with the same lighting conditions, in wide and narrow angle views, with a tripod, including videos of different aircraft, and have not seen anything like this. For example, airplanes photograph as discrete continuous objects following a path; they don’t look like randomly scattered blinking lights. These other videos don’t show the white and red objects as seen in this one and could be used as control videos to compare normal videos to this one.Immediately after I made the photography, I wondered if I had photographed anything, because this was difficult photography. It was dark, which made it difficult to use the iPhone and to even turn on the camcorder let alone focus it. But when I uploaded everything to the computer, I was amazed that everything had worked–the cameras had come on instantly and in focus.I had taken three photos by iPhone immediately after the red objects had passed on 2016.11.04 at 19:22:27, 19:22:32, and 19:22:37. These three turned out well and although I thought I had photographed nothing because I did the photography after the 2 red objects had passed and I didn’t see anything when I took the photographs, the camera appeared to photograph some sort of splotches passing in front of the camera.The videotape also turned out much better than I expected. I might have seen a few flashes when I made the video, but the actual video showed much more. When I clicked through it, one click at a time on full screen in the dark it showed many flashes and also a pair of red objects. I had set the camcorder to daytime photography to try to get the colors of the planets, this allowed me to photograph the objects in color, and it did photograph red and white flashesWhen I uploaded the three photographs into the computer, I noticed bright spots in them that photographed the same way objects would. They were generally to the east of Venus. Although the photographs were taken only 5 seconds apart the spots were not in the same place, thus it appeared that they were moving (as the two red objects had done).In order to check whether the spots were in the same place, I made computer transparencies and overlaid them. This showed that the spots were not in the same place in the photographs. Thus, they had been moving and this would make their outlines in the photographs less clear.In order to find out if the spots were part of some natural background, I looked at the photos that were taken right before I saw the two red objects. There were several of these photographs and no such spots were visible on any of these photographs. Thus, the spots didn’t appear to be part of the natural background. They also wouldn’t be some form of camera artifact.With this camera, I can easily photograph such objects as Mars and Saturn and have even photographed dimmer objects such as Neptune and asteroids, so I’m familiar with the camera’s performance. The stars and planets, of course, stand still whereas these objects were moving and thus more difficult to photograph-with less distinct outlines. I saw no airplanes at the time I took the photographs and I would have noticed them because I was looking at Venus. Moreover, it would be unusual to see three airplanes together at once, and I would definitely have noticed. The only things I had seen near Venus were the two red objects and that was a few seconds before I took the photographs. Also, I doubt if my camera would have taken photographs of birds or insects, because it was dark. The objects showed up as bright spots that looked like lit objects such as Mars. The trees photographed as dark bodies that were barely distinguishable from the background. In addition, the trees were much larger than birds and don’t more around.Although the only objects I saw were the two red ones, it appeared that I had photographed several other things. Because I had seen the red objects with my eyes, I thought the spots might have also been objects traveling with the red ones. I think they weren’t the red objects because these had been exactly vertical and the spots I photographed were in more of a horizontal configuration.Thus, it appeared that more unlit objects might have passed after I saw the two red ones. I didn’t see these when I took the photographs, so they might have been unlit but traveling with the red object/objects.These spots were a bright color and this is how the illuminated objects, such as Mars had photographed. I think if I had photographed birds, they have appeared dark. Thus, I thought that the objects might have been emitting some form of light or other radiation that could photograph, but not be visible to the human eye.I quit photographing with the iPhone, because the entire south part of the sky suddenly lit up with all kinds of flashing lights and I ran to the video camera. This also made me wonder if the bright spots were objects, because the flashing lights would have come from objects, but the only objects I had seen before this were the two red ones. Also, all I saw of the flashing lights were the flashes; I assumed the flashes were from objects that weren’t visible in the dark. Thus, perhaps the spots I saw were among the objects that flashed later but were not emitting radiation in the visible range or flashing when they passed Venus.This photography suggests that some objects might have been traveling with the red ones, but I may not have seen them because they were not lit in a light frequency visible to the human eye. Immediately after this, however, the entire sky lit up with flashing, blinking objects. Thus, they may have changed their frequency (during the flashing) to one visible to humans.Perhaps this could be a reason why it is sometimes reported that UFOs will suddenly blink out or disappear.I was able to upload the video recording, which had photographed the tail end the group of dancing objects before they disappeared behind the tree. I was also able to click through this video one click at a time in full screen in the dark and also to modify the lighting on this video to study it further.The video definitely showed some of the object’s flashing as distinct, obvious, bright objects with discrete boundaries. It also sometimes showed dimmer flashes, or bright flashes turning into dimmer onesThe video showed the blinking and color of the lit objects. These were red and white blinking objects, but no other colors were evident (but there may have other colors that just didn’t photograph). These objects appeared real because they showed up against the sky not against any background. The first two red objects that I had seen with my eyes shone a very bright red–sort of a blood red color. Two red objects that seemed to be together also showed up on the video, but these were not as red. However, a camcorder photographing in the dark might show a different color than the eye would see, even if it photographed the same thing.The white objects would blink on and off at random times in random places over a wide area of the sky. (The photography was taken over the fields of a large farm. The neighbors were relatives, and no one was doing anything odd that would cause objects to appear at that time).I had initially seen two red objects traveling to the east. Although I didn’t see this with my eyes when I took the video, it also captured two red objects that flew together and stayed on for a while–the video captured them three times. I don’t know if these red objects were the same ones I saw with my eyes at the beginning when they passed Venus. There were several rapid changes in configuration of the red objects and I don’t know whether this was caused by a red object darting from one place to another, or if there had been a larger object that turned on different red lights. I had seen no obvious connections between the two red objects in my original observation by eyesight but don’t know if these were what I was seeing in the video. Sometimes a third and maybe more red lights would be with the two that stayed together. Many of the flashes were very distinct and clear, whereas some were blurred. I don’t know if the blurring could have been caused by motion. I had very little time to film the trailing edge of the group, before they flew behind the tree (but it was still possible to slow down the recording on the computer and find a lot of detail).The video showed red objects and it sometimes showed two that would stay on for a while and traveled together. I don’t know whether the two red objects that seemed to fly together in the video were also the first two I saw with my eyes (the possibly barbell-like ones that passed Venus). These were not vertical as the ones I saw by eye were, but were tilted and more horizontally oriented. These two red objects together showed three separate times on the video. Sometimes these two objects would be in different distances from each other and in different orientations. The two red objects that sometimes appeared together did not look like blinking airplane lights, because an airplane would travel away in a straight direction and generally have more than just red lights. If these were on an airplane, it was doing unusual gyrations.I saw no strobe lights with the group of red lights that stayed together, such as airplanes have, and there was plenty of time on the video to see strobe lights.At other times, I would see three bright, clear red objects on at once, like a triangle. I couldn’t tell whether there was anything connecting the objects. Sometimes I would see several red objects together and wondered if they could all be lights on one object. I also wondered if some of the objects had quickly moved from one location to another. There seemed to be brighter sharper red objects and some dimmer ones that were more like blotches, or maybe rapidly moving objects. I don’t know if there were other colors.The red lights that traveled together in the video did not turn on or off at exactly same time (as seen in the slowed down video), although this timing was quite close to synchronous. In airplanes, such lighting would be synchronous. The first two views of the red objects that stayed together stayed on about the same amount of time, but the last one was shorter. And the time between views was less for the last one also. The distance between the red objects varied. Thus there had been no patterned sequence of blinking lights such as is on aircraft.Other oddities were that the two red objects would completely disappear between flashes. Nearly all aircraft in the dark keep at least one steady light on all the time. Their blinking pattern wasn’t regular. Also, they were higher in altitude each time they appeared. They might have been traveling upward after they had passed me at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude. If aircraft are going over the horizon, they go down. These appeared to rise as if they had just taken off, traveled upwards, or were getting closer, but they didn’t look any larger as they would if they were becoming closer. And if these were the lighting on a craft, I should have continued to see them because there was a lot of time on the video for them to show up again. But I didn’t see them again–they slowed only three times.In comparison to the red objects, when the white objects blinked, they would sometimes be on for just a tiny fraction of a second (they appeared and disappeared in one click), they generally seemed brighter and sharper than the red objects, and individual objects did not appear to move together as some of the red objects did.These were nothing like strobe lights. Although a strobe light may flash on and off quickly as these objects did, a property of strobe lights is that they are regular. There was nothing regular in the flashing of these lights. In comparison, when one watches airplane strobe lights, the strobes continue in a smooth path along with the airplane. These white objects appeared and disappeared all over a large area of the sky. Their strobing wasn’t regular, nor did any strobes follow a continuous path.There were some very distinct, bright red and white objects, but others also looked red and white, but dimmer and more blurred. I don’t remember from seeing them with my eyes if there were other colors. In general, they seemed stationary when they were lit up, but some were a little blurred as if they had started to move rapidly.No object’s flashes were recorded in the same exact place, so I photographed nothing that was fixed or stationary. I think I taped only one blink twice in almost the same location.There was no smooth movement like an airplane flying away from the camera. In several instances, an object would look double as if it were two objects together or had very rapidly moved while blinking on. The planets never appeared as double. Some of the object’s lighting seemed to have trails as if this were showing motion. Sometimes UFOs are reported as merging or coming apart. These double images suggest that the objects could be close together, or possibly even be merging.There were several indications that these objects had some form of power. One reason is that the group took a definite direction and was not simply blown with the wind. The ability to move in a different direction from the wind indicates that some form of power is in use. Also, they glowed, and this glowing would take power. In addition, they were able to blink off and on. Blinking lights such as strobe lights use different forms of power and some form of control is needed to make the light flash on and off. The ability to light up and to flash indicates that some form of both power and control existed in these objects.During the time the video was made, the camcorder was toggled between a wide (wide-angle) and a narrow (telephoto) field of view. The first portion shows a wide-angle view that includes the tree silhouettes below and to the left side of the picture. Venus and the Moon are a distance apart. Venus appears to move to the right, when the camcorder setting is changed from a wide to a narrow field of view (it doesn’t really move). A number of the flashes showed up in different places in the wide angle view and this showed how large a portion of the sky the flashes took up.Because this wide view covers such a large angular distance, if this display of the group of objects had been of aircraft lighting, it would take up a much smaller angular distance. For example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full Moon is about 31 arcmin or half a degree. A close airplane would subtend about the angular size of the Moon. The display of this group of objects was many, many times the angular size of the Moon.These object’s flashes could also be compared to the general background. I took the video of the tail end of a group of flashing objects that were headed east. Thus, there are more of these flashes on the left side. The background is dark with large irregular blotches of black, red, green, and purple that changed shape constantly and were dimmer and less defined than the flashes. The objects that flashed differ from the background because they are generally obvious, bright, and circular-shaped with well-defined edges, and smaller than the background blotches, rather than just large amorphous, changing blotches.Because the background isn’t white, I think most of the white flashes are from objects. Unlike the background, the white flashes some are very clear, and sharp, although some are smaller and dimmer. The red objects that photographed the best were also circular-shaped with fairly well defined edges. However, both red and white objects could transform from well defined into less well-defined flashes. An instance here is where two of the red objects that traveled together began as sharply defined, but became less well defined later. At 00.08 – – 00.17 two sharply defined red objects and then three were seen at first. Then the third one blinked off, but the two continued together. But as they continued, they became less well defined. At 00:10 – -00.15 the two red objects that traveled together showed for the last time. On their last blinks, both objects showed as bodies that seemed to go to the left with trails to the right. Then they disappeared and didn’t show up together again, even through there was time on the video for this to happen. Perhaps they had sped off.The white objects would often light up for only a small part of a second. They often would appear for only one click. Because they were on for such a small amount of time, it is best to go through the video one click at a time, else these very short flashes wouldn’t be seen.The bright, clear objects with distinct outlines are most frequently on the left side and middle of the video images, because the group was heading east and few bright clear ones were on the right side by the time the video was taken. However, the right side could be used as a control to show what the sky would normally look like if no blinking objects were present. Although the sky is the same on the left and right side, the blinking white and red objects are generally visible on the left side. If these objects were some kind of camera artifacts, the objects would be visible on both sides. (When I had first seen the display it was to the west of Venus and heading east and then the flashing objects covered a wide area of the sky but they were drifting to the east and by the time I had the camcorder on, I was just photographing the tail end of the group. When I took the video, I thought it might be too late to get anything, but I did photograph some of it.) Thus, because the flashing was mainly on the left side of the video, the right side might be used as a sort of control for how the normal sky would appear. I have many videos that could be compared to this one and used as controls.I disregarded the area at the bottom of the video, near the line of the tree silhouettes, when looking for object’s flashes, because there was some background lighting, which might have caused some form of photographic artifacts.The video began with a wide-angle exposure. A white light appeared at 00:00 – -00.25. It was below the Moon and to the left of Venus. Because the camcorder was recording at the wide angle setting and shows both the Moon, Venus, and silhouettes of the trees, it demonstrations that even at this stage (as the group of objects flew east) that objects could appear far enough west to show that the display took up a considerable angular distance.Two (or maybe 3) white objects appeared at 00:02 – -00:23, then more flashes appeared. Increased activity begins at about 00:07. One of several double appearing white blinks occurred at 00:08 – -00:17, another was at (00:08 – -00.07), and another at 00:015– -00:10. These may be two white lights that are near each other when they flashed. One white object flashed twice in about the same location (00:16 – -00.09 and 6 clicks later also at 00:16 – -00.09). At 00:11 – -00.14 four fairly dim white objects flashed; two of these were quite close together.At 00:13 – -00.12, a white object appears in a wide view above a tree silhouette, and 3 clicks later another white object appears to its right and some distance away compared to the tree silhouette. Nothing was visible during further clicks. One trailing, dim white object appeared to show on the right side as late as 00:19 – -00.06.The first two red objects appeared at 00:07 – -00.18, they then continue to appear together through 8 clicks until the furthest left one blinked out at (still at 00:07 – -00.18), then another one appeared below the former position of the left one (still at 00:07 – -00.18). After that two red objects appeared together again at (00:07 – -00.17), and then after another click a third red object appeared ((00:07 – -00.17). The two red objects appeared together again at 00.09 – -00.16. Sometimes a red object would appear by itself such as at 00:09 – – 00.16. At 00:08 – -00.17 two red objects that have stayed together are visible, in one click the one on the left becomes fainter and sort of appears as if it is moving down, in the next click a red object appears under the right red object that is still on, as if the left object moved to the right and under the right object which stayed lit. Because several red objects sometimes came on together, possibly they were lights on a larger craft. Sometimes they would form a triangle.Both white and red objects sometimes appeared to have trails, for example white one at 00:03 – -00.22.These red objects were sharp, but others sometimes appeared that were less sharp and I don’t know if these were just photographic artifacts, or objects with dimmer lights, or red objects in motion. Some of the white flashes were much clearer and more distinct than others. When I am recording stars or airplanes with this camera after dark, I see no flashing objects like this, so they weren’t camera artifacts. The main time there are camera artifacts on this camera’s videos is when the battery is low. These artifacts are normally rectangular-shaped and sometimes they contain colors or designs. They aren’t flashing objects like these. I just watched the video portions that were above the tree line at the bottom. There may have been artifacts along the tree silhouettes and higher because of background lighting.I posted this video on YouTube on that day and have posted more several more times. Because one could see a lot less on YouTube than on the HiDef video, I just posted several slowed down, enhancements of the video to show what some of the blinking objects looked like and a general view: https://youtu.be/P1Cge5TpIyc. I also tried adding a HiDef video, but the YouTube ones didn’t have enough pixels to show much and I received no comments.I think my iPhone was pointing in the general area of the southwest when I took the photos and the photos were in full high definition.The camcorder was mounted on a tripod and pointing south. It was a Sony HDR-HC5 HDV 1080 4MP MiniDV Hi with 10x Optical Zoom and digital zoom. The recording was made in 1080p full high-definition video on DV cassette tape. The camera has night vision, but I had it set for day vision, so I could see the color of the planets. The video was transferred to an iMac computer using iMovie. The video is large, 425 MB, and I do not know how to send it. The YouTube video upload shows much less than the actual video.I have the original photographs that I sent from my iPhone to my computer and the tracking information. I think I had GPS turned off, but the coordinates were latitude: 40.174204, and longitude – 82.964062. I also have the original videotape. My camera taped over the video, but I had downloaded it before this happened, and I have heard also that an original video can be retrieved even if something is taped over it.A second reason I have not yet reported the sighting was that I had the photos on my iPhone, but then purchased a new iPhone. The technician assured me that everything would transfer from the old phone to the new one. But later I discovered that everything had transferred except these three UFO photos and several before. I felt terrible because I thought I couldn’t verify the photos. But I just (2017.10.11) found out about EXIF data and tried this with the photographs. This worked, and I was able to extract the digital information from the photographs, as shown below:I used the Internet program camerasummary.com to extract the EXIF information and that for the first iPhone photograph is: “The image on the left is your original image and the image on the right is the thumbnail stored within the image file.

However, another portion of the photographs (not the UFO ones) did transfer from my old iPhone to the new one and these are still on my iPhone.Several people looked at the photography. One person wanted something else called the raw data on the iPhone photos. I looked for this, but it was lost during the transfer because the three UFO photos did not transfer. Since everything on the old phone was transferred at once (not separately) by an electronic process, it is strange (and very irritating) that just the UFO photos didn’t transfer. It might be interesting to try to investigate this; I still have the receipt for the new phone.”ConclusionAt this time, I am unable to determine what the witness saw that evening, and for now, it remains tagged as “Unidentified.”codepeople-post-map require JavaScriptFollow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave\n\n"

The abduction site is in the east central Arizona mountains, and is accessed only by old logging roads. After calling it a day, and with the sun going down, the crew of seven got in the truck to head home. As they traveled down the road, a UFO was spotted hovering off to the side. Travis got out, approached it, and was hit by a beam. The crew panicked and drove off, but quickly returned to find Travis missing.

The composition of each the soils consist of primarily quartz, mica and feldspars (microcline) minerals with some humates (organics). Small amounts of metallic particulates are present which contain iron oxide permutations of hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4).

However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values.3 (The amounts of minerals were not determined.)

But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO.

It was under sampled and more metal particulates analysis is needed for confirmation of their relation to the UFO effects.\nRecommendations:\n. Clearly the quantitative results for the iron containing particulates need to be further verified. So definitely, more soil sampling is needed from the site and outside the site (especially better control samples). Unfortunately, there was only limited time to collect the samples that we did get. Also there is a need to more accurately locate the site samples. They are an approximation and could be off as much as four feet. This sampling should be done in the presence of the witnesses, most importantly Travis Walton and Mike Rogers who also drew the map.\n.We would limit the testing of additional samples to ICP for iron content and magnetic drag amounts. Other testing, such as XRD and infrared analyses, probably need not be repeated as these tests already provided information needed on soil and identification of the metal particulates. Also, other testing on the soils would not provide significant information after 40 years of weathering and a forest fire, e.g. seed germination and soil assay.\n.People with expertise in different disciplines should be invited to look at these data. For example, the soil assay test results should be evaluated by an Agronomist (soil scientist). We do not have that background in this field, though we know that interaction of properties, e.g. pH, soil mineral composition, humates content, affect the results of other tests.\n.A consistent protocol for sample acquisition and treatment should be adhered to. The procedure for future testing of any UFO site soil samples should definitely include the\nThese minerals can then be replaced or exchanged by other cations (i.e., cation exchange)\n3 Cornell University Cooperative Extension, Agronomy Fact Sheet Series, Fact Sheet 22. 4 Technical Service Response No .: UT001 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\n5 Technical Service Response No .: UT030 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\nT.

Thermoluminescence is also a possibility, though this test is quite expensive. It is important to sample the UFO site as soon as possible after the event.\nProcedure:\nSamples: Fourteen soil samples were collected by Bruce Budinger and Phyllis Budinger from the Travis Walton abduction site (Apache-Sitgreaves National forest) on November 8, 2015. Seven site locations were selected, and two samples per location were collected. At each location the soils are from the surface (0 to 2\") and deeper (2\" to 5\"). Approximately one cup of soil per sampling was obtained. Following are their identifications:\n· Sample 1a (surface to 2\" depth): designated ground zero which is where the beam hit Travis Walton.\n· Sample 1b, (2\" to 5\" depth) ground zero. . Sample 2a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero; approximate area where Travis landed after being hit by the beam.\n. Sample 2b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero.\n.Sample 3a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero. . Sample 3b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero.\n.Sample 4a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n. Sample 4b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n.Sample 5a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southeast of ground zero. . Sample 5b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest Southwest of ground zero. ·Sample 6a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. . Sample 6b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. ·Sample 7a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero. . Sample 7b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero.\nThe following site map shows the approximate locations of where the samples were obtained. They are probably within four feet of the illustration. More precise locations would have been desirable with Travis Walton's guidance. Also, more time for sampling would have been desirable. (Unfortunately, time for the sample acquisition and Travis Walton's presence was not possible.) This remarkable site map was drawn by Mike Rogers circa the winter of 1998/1999. It is reduced in scale from the original. The short dash-dot lines indicate the approximate position of the UFO, which hovered about 20 feet above the small trees in the opening between the larger trees. The 'X' indicates the approximate position where Walton was standing when he was struck by the energy beam, which lifted Walton up and blew him backwards. The large dotted circle indicates the area of accelerated tree growth believed to be due to the influence of the UFO.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

Page 6\nProcedure: The soil samples were allowed to dry in the laboratory at ambient temperature. This took several days. They were then ground and sieved through a screen to remove stones and other debris.\nInfrared6 spectra were obtained from all soil samples. They were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nAll 50:50 mixes of top and bottom soil samplings from each site was sent to Brookside Laboratories, Inc. New Bremen, Ohio 45869 for soil assay and ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) elemental analysis' for specific elements which are: phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, boron, iron, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum. They were also sent for EDX elemental analysis® to Technology of Materials, Fullerton, CA 92835. Also, selected soil samplings of the 50:50 mixes (3 and 6) were sent to Technology of Materials for XRD analysis for identification of crystalline components.\nA procedure for isolating and measuring the concentration of metallic particles was developed by this laboratory and done on all 14 soil samples. It is called a \"Magnetic Drag\" test.10 Method development had to be done by this laboratory to ensure reproducible and accurate results. (This involved removing the particulates with a magnet and then washing many times with water to remove residual dirt.)\nThe isolated metal particulates from the soils 1, 3, and 5 were combined and sent to Technology of Materials for EDX elemental analysis and XRD. Additionally, photographs were obtained from the isolated particulates using a Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\n6 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n7 ICP: Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) is an analysis system in which the energy of a plasma excites the atoms of an injected sample causing the excited atoms to emit light at signature wavelengths. Three-dimensional computer-generated images are used to interpret the results. (Qualitative and quantitative information of the elements is obtained.)\n8 EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy): XRF identifies elements and their semi-quantitative amounts. Samples are stimulated with X-rays which causes them to emit X-ray fluorescence radiation. This emitted radiation is resolved into a spectrum characteristic of each element.\n9 XRD (X-ray Diffraction): X-ray Powder Diffraction is used for the identification and quantification of crystalline phases in solids and slurries. A diffraction pattern is obtained from a material by the interaction of very short wavelength light (X-rays) with the planes of atoms found in materials with long range order (crystalline matter). Constructive interference in three dimensions gives rise to the maxima found in diffractograms. Qualitative identifications can be made by computer matching the observed pattern with reference patterns in a database. 10This was informally named by W. C. Levengood , who did a similar test, and who first observed a preponderance of magnetic particles in crop circle sites.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

The organization of the specific results is: the elemental results, followed by compositional (molecular) analysis of the soils. Next are the soil assay results, and finally the qualitative and quantification of the metal particulates.\nElemental Analysis of the Soils\nSEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscope-Electron Diffraction X-ray Spectroscopy) Elemental Analysis\nThe values from the EDX elemental analysis of 50:50 blends of the top and bottom soil samples from each location are in relative percent (not absolute) and semi-quantitative at most, i.e. based on those elements detected by the instrument. Some elements definitely present, e.g. hydrogen, are not detected. There may some with overlapping peaks.

(See Soil Assay Section for the humus content.)\nThe amounts of elements of sodium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium trend lower when the humus content is higher. These elements are from the soil minerals. The\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 8\nspecific minerals are mostly quartz (SiO2) with some feldspars (potassium aluminum silicate group) and mica. (See the Mineral Composition Section)\nIron, titanium and magnesium are from the mix of iron oxides identified as hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), (See Analysis of Metal Particulates Section.) There is a high concentration of iron which is independent of the humus concentration and the wt.% values are higher than those of the control samples. Titanium and magnesium are in low amounts and trend the same direction as the iron. So these are associated with the iron (magnetite composition). This observation is further confirmed by the ICP elemental analysis of the metal particles below.\nICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) Elemental Analysis\nThis elemental analysis was also done on 50:50 blends of the top and bottom samples from each location.

Most obvious is that the iron concentration predominates over the rest of the elements in the site and control samples. More importantly, all site samples contain more iron than the controls. We speculate that the reason is due to the influence of the UFO propulsion system. It acts like a powerful electromagnet attracting iron containing particulates in the soil.\nOther elements (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, boron, manganese, copper, zinc, aluminum) also trend higher for site samples 1, 2, 3 and 5. Site sample 4 appears to be an outlier with lesser amounts of phosphorus, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum compared to the controls. Sodium and sulfur values are \"all over the map\".\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

This would indicate some chemical changes in the site samples. The detection of the difference in cationic activity in the soil is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values. (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days. In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 12\nSome of the measurements have values (pH, Estimated Nitrogen Release) that correlate with the Organic Matter (humus) content. Expectedly there is a lower pH (more acetic) and more nitrogen release with higher humus content. The phosphorus values are all over the place. Evaluation of the remaining data shows no conclusive correlation to the site samples. This is not surprising after 40 years. Still it was \"worth a shot\". (We feel the results would have shown something if the soil samples had been collected right after the event.)\nMetal Particulates Analysis\n\"Magnetic Drag\"\nThe \"Magnetic Drag\" analysis for determining the amounts of metal particulates was very informative, and showed the site samples clearly contain more metal particulates than the controls. Furthermore the metal particulates trend to have higher concentrations in the surface soil (top 2 inches) than the bottom sampling. The amount of particulates in sample 2 is close to the two controls which suggest the possibility the craft was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.

Magnetite, for example, is a common igneous accessory mineral and found in sedimentary banded iron formations.12 According to the literature, other metal impurities in magnetite may be magnesium, zinc, manganese, nickel, chromium, titanium, vanadium and aluminum, depending on the location where it's found. It should be noted that residual minerals (quartz/clay (montmorillonite)) from the soil appear to be part of the metal particle composite, i.e. infused in the metal particulates. After all the washing, this analyst went over the particles, again and again, with a magnet. They were all attracted. No other particles were magnetic.\nOne analyst13 offered that the metal particles originate from fly ash. He projected that this material would be expected to cover the Earth, especially starting from the introduction of the industrial era. The composition of these ashes varies depending on the processes that they originated from. Analyses reported in the literature for fly ash\n12Magnetite mineral information and data, http://wwwmindat.org/min-2538.html.\nNick Reiter, Personal Communication.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 16\nare not commensurate with this analysis.14 A number of metal oxides are found in fly ashes which are not in the Travis Walton site particulates.\nThere is also some conjecture that metal particulates from sites exposed to UFO activity are of meteoric origin. There is a theory which involves a \"descending ionosphere plasma\". The plasma, which originates in the ionosphere, brings meteoric dust to the ground. That is, this meteoric dust is drawn into the descending plasma system by strong magnetic fields. The strong magnetic field could be generated by a UFO propulsion system.15 However, the elemental data of particulates from this analysis do not compare to those reported for most meteorites. For example, there is only a trace of nickel. This value should be much higher if the particulates were meteoric dust. 16 An excellent Washington University in St. Louis article reports, \"About 95% of all meteorites contain iron- nickel (FeNi) metal. Iron-Nickel means that the metal is mostly iron, but it contains 4-30% nickel, as well as a few tenths of a percent cobalt. Iron-Nickel in meteorites also has high concentrations (by terrestrial standards) of rare metals like gold, platinum and iridium.\" The common chondrite meteorites account for 86% of all meteorites recovered. 17\nFile: UT095\nPhyllis A.

Budinger Analytical Scientist Bruce O. Budinger Composite Ceramics Scientist\nThe Travis Walton abduction is well known to most people reading this. Suffice to say he was part of a logging crew on November 5, 1975 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. The abduction site is in the east central Arizona mountains, and is accessed only by old logging roads. After calling it a day, and with the sun going down, the crew of seven got in the truck to head home. As they traveled down the road, a UFO was spotted hovering off to the side. Travis got out, approached it, and was hit by a beam. The crew panicked and drove off, but quickly returned to find Travis missing. He was gone five days, and then reappeared just outside Heber, Arizona. For details on this event, see his site www.travis-walton.com or read Travis Walton's book \"Fire in the Sky\".\nThough the event happened 40 years ago, soil samples were collected from the site, along with nearby control samples. It should be noted that besides 40 years of weathering, a massive forest fire occurred in 2002 which devastated the area. Still, it was hoped that if a permanent change was made to the soil due to the UFO's proximity, it would be detected.\nThis laboratory is also in possession of wood core samples from the site. The trees were cored 24 years after the event in winter 1998/1999 by Mike Rogers before the forest fire. He sent cores to W. C. Levengood. Levengood passed them along to this laboratory September 2012. The core samples are intriguing because of the tree rings. Wide rings from the site trees show that from the time of the abduction in 1975, and for 15 years afterwards, they experienced rapid growth. Cores of trees just outside the site show no rapid growth. Furthermore it was observed in January 2012 that the wide rings are not concentric around the trunk. That is, they are elliptical and even wider where they faced the UFO. Some testing has been done on selected core samples and is not completed. This analysis will not be addressed in this report.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nThe objective of this project is to determine whether the analysis of the soils will detect any anomalies which can be related to an unknown craft (UFO). Also it hoped to be informative to other scientists/investigators that may be able to add input and further interpretation to build on what is found. It is also desired that the information and testing serves as a protocol for future testing of soil samples related to UFO events. That is, which procedures and tests should be done.\nAcknowledgement:\nWhile this project was personally generated and primarily financed by this laboratory, we must acknowledge and thank our friend and colleague Dr. Sampath Iyengar for discounting and partially donating his services for EDX elemental analysis and XRD characterization of the soil samples and magnetic particles.\nConclusions:\n. The composition of each the soils consist of primarily quartz, mica and feldspars (microcline) minerals with some humates (organics). Small amounts of metallic particulates are present which contain iron oxide permutations of hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). Quantitatively the amounts of these components vary between the samples.\n.It is revealed that iron containing particulates amounts are higher in the site soils compared to the control soils. Furthermore, there is indication that the levels tend to be higher in the surface soils compared to the sub-surface soils of the site samples. This laboratory speculates that the hovering craft propulsion system has a powerful electromagnetic effect thereby drawing (and concentrating) these iron particulates toward the surface. This has been observed in the analysis of soils from other sites where UFOs landed or hovered close to the ground.1 It was more specifically noted that sample 2 contains less particlulates compared to the other site samples, but slightly more than the controls. Soil 2 is approximately where Travis landed after the beam hit him. Perhaps this suggests that the UFO was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.\n· The exchangeable cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium) are significantly higher in the site samples than the control samples2. This would indicate some chemical\n1 Unreported soil samples from Stevensville, Montana.\n2 Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) Cation-exchange capacity is defined as the degree to which a soil can adsorb and exchange cations. (Cation-a positively charged ion (NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Fe2+, etc ... ) Anion-a negatively charged ion )(NO3 , PO42, SO42, etc ... )\nSoil particles and organic matter have negative charges on their surfaces. Mineral cations can adsorb to the negative surface charges or the inorganic and organic soil particles. Once adsorbed, these minerals are not easily lost when the soil is leached by water and they also provide a nutrient reserve available to plant roots.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nchanges in the site samples. The detection of the differences in cationic activity in the soils is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values.3 (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO, because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft, causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing what turned out to be mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days.4 In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.5\n.We believe this analysis justifies additional examination of soil samples from the site. It was under sampled and more metal particulates analysis is needed for confirmation of their relation to the UFO effects.\nRecommendations:\n. Clearly the quantitative results for the iron containing particulates need to be further verified. So definitely, more soil sampling is needed from the site and outside the site (especially better control samples). Unfortunately, there was only limited time to collect the samples that we did get. Also there is a need to more accurately locate the site samples. They are an approximation and could be off as much as four feet. This sampling should be done in the presence of the witnesses, most importantly Travis Walton and Mike Rogers who also drew the map.\n.We would limit the testing of additional samples to ICP for iron content and magnetic drag amounts. Other testing, such as XRD and infrared analyses, probably need not be repeated as these tests already provided information needed on soil and identification of the metal particulates. Also, other testing on the soils would not provide significant information after 40 years of weathering and a forest fire, e.g. seed germination and soil assay.\n.People with expertise in different disciplines should be invited to look at these data. For example, the soil assay test results should be evaluated by an Agronomist (soil scientist). We do not have that background in this field, though we know that interaction of properties, e.g. pH, soil mineral composition, humates content, affect the results of other tests.\n.A consistent protocol for sample acquisition and treatment should be adhered to. The procedure for future testing of any UFO site soil samples should definitely include the\nThese minerals can then be replaced or exchanged by other cations (i.e., cation exchange)\n3 Cornell University Cooperative Extension, Agronomy Fact Sheet Series, Fact Sheet 22. 4 Technical Service Response No .: UT001 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\n5 Technical Service Response No .: UT030 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\nT.

Thermoluminescence is also a possibility, though this test is quite expensive. It is important to sample the UFO site as soon as possible after the event.\nProcedure:\nSamples: Fourteen soil samples were collected by Bruce Budinger and Phyllis Budinger from the Travis Walton abduction site (Apache-Sitgreaves National forest) on November 8, 2015. Seven site locations were selected, and two samples per location were collected. At each location the soils are from the surface (0 to 2\") and deeper (2\" to 5\"). Approximately one cup of soil per sampling was obtained. Following are their identifications:\n· Sample 1a (surface to 2\" depth): designated ground zero which is where the beam hit Travis Walton.\n· Sample 1b, (2\" to 5\" depth) ground zero. . Sample 2a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero; approximate area where Travis landed after being hit by the beam.\n. Sample 2b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero.\n.Sample 3a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero. . Sample 3b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero.\n.Sample 4a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n. Sample 4b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n.Sample 5a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southeast of ground zero. . Sample 5b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest Southwest of ground zero. ·Sample 6a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. . Sample 6b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. ·Sample 7a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero. . Sample 7b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero.\nThe following site map shows the approximate locations of where the samples were obtained. They are probably within four feet of the illustration. More precise locations would have been desirable with Travis Walton's guidance. Also, more time for sampling would have been desirable. (Unfortunately, time for the sample acquisition and Travis Walton's presence was not possible.) This remarkable site map was drawn by Mike Rogers circa the winter of 1998/1999. It is reduced in scale from the original. The short dash-dot lines indicate the approximate position of the UFO, which hovered about 20 feet above the small trees in the opening between the larger trees. The 'X' indicates the approximate position where Walton was standing when he was struck by the energy beam, which lifted Walton up and blew him backwards. The large dotted circle indicates the area of accelerated tree growth believed to be due to the influence of the UFO.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

Page 6\nProcedure: The soil samples were allowed to dry in the laboratory at ambient temperature. This took several days. They were then ground and sieved through a screen to remove stones and other debris.\nInfrared6 spectra were obtained from all soil samples. They were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nAll 50:50 mixes of top and bottom soil samplings from each site was sent to Brookside Laboratories, Inc. New Bremen, Ohio 45869 for soil assay and ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) elemental analysis' for specific elements which are: phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, boron, iron, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum. They were also sent for EDX elemental analysis® to Technology of Materials, Fullerton, CA 92835. Also, selected soil samplings of the 50:50 mixes (3 and 6) were sent to Technology of Materials for XRD analysis for identification of crystalline components.\nA procedure for isolating and measuring the concentration of metallic particles was developed by this laboratory and done on all 14 soil samples. It is called a \"Magnetic Drag\" test.10 Method development had to be done by this laboratory to ensure reproducible and accurate results. (This involved removing the particulates with a magnet and then washing many times with water to remove residual dirt.)\nThe isolated metal particulates from the soils 1, 3, and 5 were combined and sent to Technology of Materials for EDX elemental analysis and XRD. Additionally, photographs were obtained from the isolated particulates using a Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\n6 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n7 ICP: Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) is an analysis system in which the energy of a plasma excites the atoms of an injected sample causing the excited atoms to emit light at signature wavelengths. Three-dimensional computer-generated images are used to interpret the results. (Qualitative and quantitative information of the elements is obtained.)\n8 EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy): XRF identifies elements and their semi-quantitative amounts. Samples are stimulated with X-rays which causes them to emit X-ray fluorescence radiation. This emitted radiation is resolved into a spectrum characteristic of each element.\n9 XRD (X-ray Diffraction): X-ray Powder Diffraction is used for the identification and quantification of crystalline phases in solids and slurries. A diffraction pattern is obtained from a material by the interaction of very short wavelength light (X-rays) with the planes of atoms found in materials with long range order (crystalline matter). Constructive interference in three dimensions gives rise to the maxima found in diffractograms. Qualitative identifications can be made by computer matching the observed pattern with reference patterns in a database. 10This was informally named by W. C. Levengood , who did a similar test, and who first observed a preponderance of magnetic particles in crop circle sites.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

The organization of the specific results is: the elemental results, followed by compositional (molecular) analysis of the soils. Next are the soil assay results, and finally the qualitative and quantification of the metal particulates.\nElemental Analysis of the Soils\nSEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscope-Electron Diffraction X-ray Spectroscopy) Elemental Analysis\nThe values from the EDX elemental analysis of 50:50 blends of the top and bottom soil samples from each location are in relative percent (not absolute) and semi-quantitative at most, i.e. based on those elements detected by the instrument.

(See Soil Assay Section for the humus content.)\nThe amounts of elements of sodium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium trend lower when the humus content is higher. These elements are from the soil minerals. The\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 8\nspecific minerals are mostly quartz (SiO2) with some feldspars (potassium aluminum silicate group) and mica. (See the Mineral Composition Section)\nIron, titanium and magnesium are from the mix of iron oxides identified as hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), (See Analysis of Metal Particulates Section.) There is a high concentration of iron which is independent of the humus concentration and the wt.% values are higher than those of the control samples. Titanium and magnesium are in low amounts and trend the same direction as the iron. So these are associated with the iron (magnetite composition). This observation is further confirmed by the ICP elemental analysis of the metal particles below.\nICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) Elemental Analysis\nThis elemental analysis was also done on 50:50 blends of the top and bottom samples from each location.

Most obvious is that the iron concentration predominates over the rest of the elements in the site and control samples. More importantly, all site samples contain more iron than the controls. We speculate that the reason is due to the influence of the UFO propulsion system. It acts like a powerful electromagnet attracting iron containing particulates in the soil.\nOther elements (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, boron, manganese, copper, zinc, aluminum) also trend higher for site samples 1, 2, 3 and 5. Site sample 4 appears to be an outlier with lesser amounts of phosphorus, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum compared to the controls. Sodium and sulfur values are \"all over the map\".\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

This is an excellent technique for identification of crystalline material. The mineral contents of both samples are the same.

This would indicate some chemical changes in the site samples. The detection of the difference in cationic activity in the soil is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values. (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days. In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 12\nSome of the measurements have values (pH, Estimated Nitrogen Release) that correlate with the Organic Matter (humus) content. Expectedly there is a lower pH (more acetic) and more nitrogen release with higher humus content. The phosphorus values are all over the place. Evaluation of the remaining data shows no conclusive correlation to the site samples. This is not surprising after 40 years. Still it was \"worth a shot\". (We feel the results would have shown something if the soil samples had been collected right after the event.)\nMetal Particulates Analysis\n\"Magnetic Drag\"\nThe \"Magnetic Drag\" analysis for determining the amounts of metal particulates was very informative, and showed the site samples clearly contain more metal particulates than the controls. Furthermore the metal particulates trend to have higher concentrations in the surface soil (top 2 inches) than the bottom sampling. The amount of particulates in sample 2 is close to the two controls which suggest the possibility the craft was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.

Magnetite, for example, is a common igneous accessory mineral and found in sedimentary banded iron formations.12 According to the literature, other metal impurities in magnetite may be magnesium, zinc, manganese, nickel, chromium, titanium, vanadium and aluminum, depending on the location where it's found. It should be noted that residual minerals (quartz/clay (montmorillonite)) from the soil appear to be part of the metal particle composite, i.e. infused in the metal particulates. After all the washing, this analyst went over the particles, again and again, with a magnet. They were all attracted. No other particles were magnetic.\nOne analyst13 offered that the metal particles originate from fly ash. He projected that this material would be expected to cover the Earth, especially starting from the introduction of the industrial era. The composition of these ashes varies depending on the processes that they originated from. Analyses reported in the literature for fly ash\n12Magnetite mineral information and data, http://wwwmindat.org/min-2538.html.\nNick Reiter, Personal Communication.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 16\nare not commensurate with this analysis.14 A number of metal oxides are found in fly ashes which are not in the Travis Walton site particulates.\nThere is also some conjecture that metal particulates from sites exposed to UFO activity are of meteoric origin. There is a theory which involves a \"descending ionosphere plasma\". The plasma, which originates in the ionosphere, brings meteoric dust to the ground. That is, this meteoric dust is drawn into the descending plasma system by strong magnetic fields. The strong magnetic field could be generated by a UFO propulsion system.15 However, the elemental data of particulates from this analysis do not compare to those reported for most meteorites. For example, there is only a trace of nickel. This value should be much higher if the particulates were meteoric dust. 16 An excellent Washington University in St. Louis article reports, \"About 95% of all meteorites contain iron- nickel (FeNi) metal. Iron-Nickel means that the metal is mostly iron, but it contains 4-30% nickel, as well as a few tenths of a percent cobalt. Iron-Nickel in meteorites also has high concentrations (by terrestrial standards) of rare metals like gold, platinum and iridium.\" The common chondrite meteorites account for 86% of all meteorites recovered. 17\nFile: UT095\nPhyllis A.

The composition of each the soils consist of primarily quartz, mica and feldspars (microcline) minerals with some humates (organics).

However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values.3 (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO, because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft, causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity.

It was under sampled and more metal particulates analysis is needed for confirmation of their relation to the UFO effects.\nRecommendations:\n. Clearly the quantitative results for the iron containing particulates need to be further verified. So definitely, more soil sampling is needed from the site and outside the site (especially better control samples). Unfortunately, there was only limited time to collect the samples that we did get. Also there is a need to more accurately locate the site samples. They are an approximation and could be off as much as four feet. This sampling should be done in the presence of the witnesses, most importantly Travis Walton and Mike Rogers who also drew the map.\n.We would limit the testing of additional samples to ICP for iron content and magnetic drag amounts. Other testing, such as XRD and infrared analyses, probably need not be repeated as these tests already provided information needed on soil and identification of the metal particulates. Also, other testing on the soils would not provide significant information after 40 years of weathering and a forest fire, e.g. seed germination and soil assay.\n.People with expertise in different disciplines should be invited to look at these data. For example, the soil assay test results should be evaluated by an Agronomist (soil scientist). We do not have that background in this field, though we know that interaction of properties, e.g. pH, soil mineral composition, humates content, affect the results of other tests.\n.A consistent protocol for sample acquisition and treatment should be adhered to. The procedure for future testing of any UFO site soil samples should definitely include the\nThese minerals can then be replaced or exchanged by other cations (i.e., cation exchange)\n3 Cornell University Cooperative Extension, Agronomy Fact Sheet Series, Fact Sheet 22. 4 Technical Service Response No .: UT001 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\n5 Technical Service Response No .: UT030 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\nT.

Thermoluminescence is also a possibility, though this test is quite expensive. It is important to sample the UFO site as soon as possible after the event.\nProcedure:\nSamples: Fourteen soil samples were collected by Bruce Budinger and Phyllis Budinger from the Travis Walton abduction site (Apache-Sitgreaves National forest) on November 8, 2015. Seven site locations were selected, and two samples per location were collected. At each location the soils are from the surface (0 to 2\") and deeper (2\" to 5\"). Approximately one cup of soil per sampling was obtained. Following are their identifications:\n· Sample 1a (surface to 2\" depth): designated ground zero which is where the beam hit Travis Walton.\n· Sample 1b, (2\" to 5\" depth) ground zero. . Sample 2a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero; approximate area where Travis landed after being hit by the beam.\n. Sample 2b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero.\n.Sample 3a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero. . Sample 3b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero.\n.Sample 4a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n. Sample 4b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n.Sample 5a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southeast of ground zero. . Sample 5b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest Southwest of ground zero. ·Sample 6a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. . Sample 6b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. ·Sample 7a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero. . Sample 7b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero.\nThe following site map shows the approximate locations of where the samples were obtained. They are probably within four feet of the illustration. More precise locations would have been desirable with Travis Walton's guidance. Also, more time for sampling would have been desirable. (Unfortunately, time for the sample acquisition and Travis Walton's presence was not possible.) This remarkable site map was drawn by Mike Rogers circa the winter of 1998/1999. It is reduced in scale from the original. The short dash-dot lines indicate the approximate position of the UFO, which hovered about 20 feet above the small trees in the opening between the larger trees. The 'X' indicates the approximate position where Walton was standing when he was struck by the energy beam, which lifted Walton up and blew him backwards. The large dotted circle indicates the area of accelerated tree growth believed to be due to the influence of the UFO.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

Page 6\nProcedure: The soil samples were allowed to dry in the laboratory at ambient temperature. This took several days. They were then ground and sieved through a screen to remove stones and other debris.\nInfrared6 spectra were obtained from all soil samples. They were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nAll 50:50 mixes of top and bottom soil samplings from each site was sent to Brookside Laboratories, Inc. New Bremen, Ohio 45869 for soil assay and ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) elemental analysis' for specific elements which are: phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, boron, iron, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum. They were also sent for EDX elemental analysis® to Technology of Materials, Fullerton, CA 92835. Also, selected soil samplings of the 50:50 mixes (3 and 6) were sent to Technology of Materials for XRD analysis for identification of crystalline components.\nA procedure for isolating and measuring the concentration of metallic particles was developed by this laboratory and done on all 14 soil samples. It is called a \"Magnetic Drag\" test.10 Method development had to be done by this laboratory to ensure reproducible and accurate results. (This involved removing the particulates with a magnet and then washing many times with water to remove residual dirt.)\nThe isolated metal particulates from the soils 1, 3, and 5 were combined and sent to Technology of Materials for EDX elemental analysis and XRD. Additionally, photographs were obtained from the isolated particulates using a Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\n6 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n7 ICP: Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) is an analysis system in which the energy of a plasma excites the atoms of an injected sample causing the excited atoms to emit light at signature wavelengths. Three-dimensional computer-generated images are used to interpret the results. (Qualitative and quantitative information of the elements is obtained.)\n8 EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy): XRF identifies elements and their semi-quantitative amounts. Samples are stimulated with X-rays which causes them to emit X-ray fluorescence radiation. This emitted radiation is resolved into a spectrum characteristic of each element.\n9 XRD (X-ray Diffraction): X-ray Powder Diffraction is used for the identification and quantification of crystalline phases in solids and slurries. A diffraction pattern is obtained from a material by the interaction of very short wavelength light (X-rays) with the planes of atoms found in materials with long range order (crystalline matter). Constructive interference in three dimensions gives rise to the maxima found in diffractograms. Qualitative identifications can be made by computer matching the observed pattern with reference patterns in a database. 10This was informally named by W. C. Levengood , who did a similar test, and who first observed a preponderance of magnetic particles in crop circle sites.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

The organization of the specific results is: the elemental results, followed by compositional (molecular) analysis of the soils. Next are the soil assay results, and finally the qualitative and quantification of the metal particulates.\nElemental Analysis of the Soils\nSEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscope-Electron Diffraction X-ray Spectroscopy) Elemental Analysis\nThe values from the EDX elemental analysis of 50:50 blends of the top and bottom soil samples from each location are in relative percent (not absolute) and semi-quantitative at most, i.e. based on those elements detected by the instrument. Some elements definitely present, e.g. hydrogen, are not detected. There may some with overlapping peaks.

(See Soil Assay Section for the humus content.)\nThe amounts of elements of sodium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium trend lower when the humus content is higher. These elements are from the soil minerals. The\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 8\nspecific minerals are mostly quartz (SiO2) with some feldspars (potassium aluminum silicate group) and mica. (See the Mineral Composition Section)\nIron, titanium and magnesium are from the mix of iron oxides identified as hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), (See Analysis of Metal Particulates Section.) There is a high concentration of iron which is independent of the humus concentration and the wt.% values are higher than those of the control samples. Titanium and magnesium are in low amounts and trend the same direction as the iron. So these are associated with the iron (magnetite composition). This observation is further confirmed by the ICP elemental analysis of the metal particles below.\nICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) Elemental Analysis\nThis elemental analysis was also done on 50:50 blends of the top and bottom samples from each location.

Most obvious is that the iron concentration predominates over the rest of the elements in the site and control samples. More importantly, all site samples contain more iron than the controls. We speculate that the reason is due to the influence of the UFO propulsion system. It acts like a powerful electromagnet attracting iron containing particulates in the soil.\nOther elements (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, boron, manganese, copper, zinc, aluminum) also trend higher for site samples 1, 2, 3 and 5. Site sample 4 appears to be an outlier with lesser amounts of phosphorus, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum compared to the controls. Sodium and sulfur values are \"all over the map\".\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

This would indicate some chemical changes in the site samples. The detection of the difference in cationic activity in the soil is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values. (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days. In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 12\nSome of the measurements have values (pH, Estimated Nitrogen Release) that correlate with the Organic Matter (humus) content. Expectedly there is a lower pH (more acetic) and more nitrogen release with higher humus content. The phosphorus values are all over the place. Evaluation of the remaining data shows no conclusive correlation to the site samples. This is not surprising after 40 years. Still it was \"worth a shot\". (We feel the results would have shown something if the soil samples had been collected right after the event.)\nMetal Particulates Analysis\n\"Magnetic Drag\"\nThe \"Magnetic Drag\" analysis for determining the amounts of metal particulates was very informative, and showed the site samples clearly contain more metal particulates than the controls. Furthermore the metal particulates trend to have higher concentrations in the surface soil (top 2 inches) than the bottom sampling. The amount of particulates in sample 2 is close to the two controls which suggest the possibility the craft was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.

Magnetite, for example, is a common igneous accessory mineral and found in sedimentary banded iron formations.12 According to the literature, other metal impurities in magnetite may be magnesium, zinc, manganese, nickel, chromium, titanium, vanadium and aluminum, depending on the location where it's found. It should be noted that residual minerals (quartz/clay (montmorillonite)) from the soil appear to be part of the metal particle composite, i.e. infused in the metal particulates. After all the washing, this analyst went over the particles, again and again, with a magnet. They were all attracted. No other particles were magnetic.\nOne analyst13 offered that the metal particles originate from fly ash. He projected that this material would be expected to cover the Earth, especially starting from the introduction of the industrial era. The composition of these ashes varies depending on the processes that they originated from. Analyses reported in the literature for fly ash\n12Magnetite mineral information and data, http://wwwmindat.org/min-2538.html.\nNick Reiter, Personal Communication.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 16\nare not commensurate with this analysis.14 A number of metal oxides are found in fly ashes which are not in the Travis Walton site particulates.\nThere is also some conjecture that metal particulates from sites exposed to UFO activity are of meteoric origin. There is a theory which involves a \"descending ionosphere plasma\". The plasma, which originates in the ionosphere, brings meteoric dust to the ground. That is, this meteoric dust is drawn into the descending plasma system by strong magnetic fields. The strong magnetic field could be generated by a UFO propulsion system.15 However, the elemental data of particulates from this analysis do not compare to those reported for most meteorites. For example, there is only a trace of nickel. This value should be much higher if the particulates were meteoric dust. 16 An excellent Washington University in St. Louis article reports, \"About 95% of all meteorites contain iron- nickel (FeNi) metal. Iron-Nickel means that the metal is mostly iron, but it contains 4-30% nickel, as well as a few tenths of a percent cobalt. Iron-Nickel in meteorites also has high concentrations (by terrestrial standards) of rare metals like gold, platinum and iridium.\" The common chondrite meteorites account for 86% of all meteorites recovered. 17\nFile: UT095\nPhyllis A.

Budinger Analytical Scientist Bruce O. Budinger Composite Ceramics Scientist\nThe Travis Walton abduction is well known to most people reading this. Suffice to say he was part of a logging crew on November 5, 1975 in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. The abduction site is in the east central Arizona mountains, and is accessed only by old logging roads. After calling it a day, and with the sun going down, the crew of seven got in the truck to head home. As they traveled down the road, a UFO was spotted hovering off to the side. Travis got out, approached it, and was hit by a beam. The crew panicked and drove off, but quickly returned to find Travis missing. He was gone five days, and then reappeared just outside Heber, Arizona. For details on this event, see his site www.travis-walton.com or read Travis Walton's book \"Fire in the Sky\".\nThough the event happened 40 years ago, soil samples were collected from the site, along with nearby control samples. It should be noted that besides 40 years of weathering, a massive forest fire occurred in 2002 which devastated the area. Still, it was hoped that if a permanent change was made to the soil due to the UFO's proximity, it would be detected.\nThis laboratory is also in possession of wood core samples from the site. The trees were cored 24 years after the event in winter 1998/1999 by Mike Rogers before the forest fire. He sent cores to W. C. Levengood. Levengood passed them along to this laboratory September 2012. The core samples are intriguing because of the tree rings. Wide rings from the site trees show that from the time of the abduction in 1975, and for 15 years afterwards, they experienced rapid growth. Cores of trees just outside the site show no rapid growth. Furthermore it was observed in January 2012 that the wide rings are not concentric around the trunk. That is, they are elliptical and even wider where they faced the UFO. Some testing has been done on selected core samples and is not completed. This analysis will not be addressed in this report.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nThe objective of this project is to determine whether the analysis of the soils will detect any anomalies which can be related to an unknown craft (UFO). Also it hoped to be informative to other scientists/investigators that may be able to add input and further interpretation to build on what is found. It is also desired that the information and testing serves as a protocol for future testing of soil samples related to UFO events. That is, which procedures and tests should be done.\nAcknowledgement:\nWhile this project was personally generated and primarily financed by this laboratory, we must acknowledge and thank our friend and colleague Dr. Sampath Iyengar for discounting and partially donating his services for EDX elemental analysis and XRD characterization of the soil samples and magnetic particles.\nConclusions:\n. The composition of each the soils consist of primarily quartz, mica and feldspars (microcline) minerals with some humates (organics). Small amounts of metallic particulates are present which contain iron oxide permutations of hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4). Quantitatively the amounts of these components vary between the samples.\n.It is revealed that iron containing particulates amounts are higher in the site soils compared to the control soils. Furthermore, there is indication that the levels tend to be higher in the surface soils compared to the sub-surface soils of the site samples. This laboratory speculates that the hovering craft propulsion system has a powerful electromagnetic effect thereby drawing (and concentrating) these iron particulates toward the surface. This has been observed in the analysis of soils from other sites where UFOs landed or hovered close to the ground.1 It was more specifically noted that sample 2 contains less particlulates compared to the other site samples, but slightly more than the controls. Soil 2 is approximately where Travis landed after the beam hit him. Perhaps this suggests that the UFO was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.\n· The exchangeable cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium) are significantly higher in the site samples than the control samples2. This would indicate some chemical\n1 Unreported soil samples from Stevensville, Montana.\n2 Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) Cation-exchange capacity is defined as the degree to which a soil can adsorb and exchange cations. (Cation-a positively charged ion (NH4+, K+, Ca2+, Fe2+, etc ... ) Anion-a negatively charged ion )(NO3 , PO42, SO42, etc ... )\nSoil particles and organic matter have negative charges on their surfaces. Mineral cations can adsorb to the negative surface charges or the inorganic and organic soil particles. Once adsorbed, these minerals are not easily lost when the soil is leached by water and they also provide a nutrient reserve available to plant roots.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nchanges in the site samples. The detection of the differences in cationic activity in the soils is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values.3 (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO, because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft, causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing what turned out to be mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days.4 In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.5\n.We believe this analysis justifies additional examination of soil samples from the site. It was under sampled and more metal particulates analysis is needed for confirmation of their relation to the UFO effects.\nRecommendations:\n. Clearly the quantitative results for the iron containing particulates need to be further verified. So definitely, more soil sampling is needed from the site and outside the site (especially better control samples). Unfortunately, there was only limited time to collect the samples that we did get. Also there is a need to more accurately locate the site samples. They are an approximation and could be off as much as four feet. This sampling should be done in the presence of the witnesses, most importantly Travis Walton and Mike Rogers who also drew the map.\n.We would limit the testing of additional samples to ICP for iron content and magnetic drag amounts. Other testing, such as XRD and infrared analyses, probably need not be repeated as these tests already provided information needed on soil and identification of the metal particulates. Also, other testing on the soils would not provide significant information after 40 years of weathering and a forest fire, e.g. seed germination and soil assay.\n.People with expertise in different disciplines should be invited to look at these data. For example, the soil assay test results should be evaluated by an Agronomist (soil scientist). We do not have that background in this field, though we know that interaction of properties, e.g. pH, soil mineral composition, humates content, affect the results of other tests.\n.A consistent protocol for sample acquisition and treatment should be adhered to. The procedure for future testing of any UFO site soil samples should definitely include the\nThese minerals can then be replaced or exchanged by other cations (i.e., cation exchange)\n3 Cornell University Cooperative Extension, Agronomy Fact Sheet Series, Fact Sheet 22. 4 Technical Service Response No .: UT001 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\n5 Technical Service Response No .: UT030 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.\nT.

Thermoluminescence is also a possibility, though this test is quite expensive. It is important to sample the UFO site as soon as possible after the event.\nProcedure:\nSamples: Fourteen soil samples were collected by Bruce Budinger and Phyllis Budinger from the Travis Walton abduction site (Apache-Sitgreaves National forest) on November 8, 2015. Seven site locations were selected, and two samples per location were collected. At each location the soils are from the surface (0 to 2\") and deeper (2\" to 5\"). Approximately one cup of soil per sampling was obtained. Following are their identifications:\n· Sample 1a (surface to 2\" depth): designated ground zero which is where the beam hit Travis Walton.\n· Sample 1b, (2\" to 5\" depth) ground zero. . Sample 2a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero; approximate area where Travis landed after being hit by the beam.\n. Sample 2b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Northeast of ground zero.\n.Sample 3a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero. . Sample 3b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' Southwest of ground zero.\n.Sample 4a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n. Sample 4b (2\" to 5\" depth): 15' East of ground zero.\n.Sample 5a (surface to 2\" depth): 15' Southeast of ground zero. . Sample 5b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest Southwest of ground zero. ·Sample 6a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. . Sample 6b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 50' Northwest of ground zero. ·Sample 7a (surface to 2\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero. . Sample 7b (2\" to 5\" depth): (CONTROL) 58' East of ground zero.\nThe following site map shows the approximate locations of where the samples were obtained. They are probably within four feet of the illustration. More precise locations would have been desirable with Travis Walton's guidance. Also, more time for sampling would have been desirable. (Unfortunately, time for the sample acquisition and Travis Walton's presence was not possible.) This remarkable site map was drawn by Mike Rogers circa the winter of 1998/1999. It is reduced in scale from the original. The short dash-dot lines indicate the approximate position of the UFO, which hovered about 20 feet above the small trees in the opening between the larger trees. The 'X' indicates the approximate position where Walton was standing when he was struck by the energy beam, which lifted Walton up and blew him backwards. The large dotted circle indicates the area of accelerated tree growth believed to be due to the influence of the UFO.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

Page 6\nProcedure: The soil samples were allowed to dry in the laboratory at ambient temperature. This took several days. They were then ground and sieved through a screen to remove stones and other debris.\nInfrared6 spectra were obtained from all soil samples. They were acquired on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory.\nAll 50:50 mixes of top and bottom soil samplings from each site was sent to Brookside Laboratories, Inc. New Bremen, Ohio 45869 for soil assay and ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) elemental analysis' for specific elements which are: phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, boron, iron, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum. They were also sent for EDX elemental analysis® to Technology of Materials, Fullerton, CA 92835. Also, selected soil samplings of the 50:50 mixes (3 and 6) were sent to Technology of Materials for XRD analysis for identification of crystalline components.\nA procedure for isolating and measuring the concentration of metallic particles was developed by this laboratory and done on all 14 soil samples. It is called a \"Magnetic Drag\" test.10 Method development had to be done by this laboratory to ensure reproducible and accurate results. (This involved removing the particulates with a magnet and then washing many times with water to remove residual dirt.)\nThe isolated metal particulates from the soils 1, 3, and 5 were combined and sent to Technology of Materials for EDX elemental analysis and XRD. Additionally, photographs were obtained from the isolated particulates using a Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\n6 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\n7 ICP: Inductively Coupled Plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) is an analysis system in which the energy of a plasma excites the atoms of an injected sample causing the excited atoms to emit light at signature wavelengths. Three-dimensional computer-generated images are used to interpret the results. (Qualitative and quantitative information of the elements is obtained.)\n8 EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy): XRF identifies elements and their semi-quantitative amounts. Samples are stimulated with X-rays which causes them to emit X-ray fluorescence radiation. This emitted radiation is resolved into a spectrum characteristic of each element.\n9 XRD (X-ray Diffraction): X-ray Powder Diffraction is used for the identification and quantification of crystalline phases in solids and slurries. A diffraction pattern is obtained from a material by the interaction of very short wavelength light (X-rays) with the planes of atoms found in materials with long range order (crystalline matter). Constructive interference in three dimensions gives rise to the maxima found in diffractograms. Qualitative identifications can be made by computer matching the observed pattern with reference patterns in a database. 10This was informally named by W. C. Levengood , who did a similar test, and who first observed a preponderance of magnetic particles in crop circle sites.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

The organization of the specific results is: the elemental results, followed by compositional (molecular) analysis of the soils. Next are the soil assay results, and finally the qualitative and quantification of the metal particulates.\nElemental Analysis of the Soils\nSEM-EDX (Scanning Electron Microscope-Electron Diffraction X-ray Spectroscopy) Elemental Analysis\nThe values from the EDX elemental analysis of 50:50 blends of the top and bottom soil samples from each location are in relative percent (not absolute) and semi-quantitative at most, i.e. based on those elements detected by the instrument.

(See Soil Assay Section for the humus content.)\nThe amounts of elements of sodium, aluminum, silicon, potassium, calcium trend lower when the humus content is higher. These elements are from the soil minerals. The\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 8\nspecific minerals are mostly quartz (SiO2) with some feldspars (potassium aluminum silicate group) and mica. (See the Mineral Composition Section)\nIron, titanium and magnesium are from the mix of iron oxides identified as hematite (Fe2O3), ilmenite (FeTiO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4), (See Analysis of Metal Particulates Section.) There is a high concentration of iron which is independent of the humus concentration and the wt.% values are higher than those of the control samples. Titanium and magnesium are in low amounts and trend the same direction as the iron. So these are associated with the iron (magnetite composition). This observation is further confirmed by the ICP elemental analysis of the metal particles below.\nICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) Elemental Analysis\nThis elemental analysis was also done on 50:50 blends of the top and bottom samples from each location.

Most obvious is that the iron concentration predominates over the rest of the elements in the site and control samples. More importantly, all site samples contain more iron than the controls. We speculate that the reason is due to the influence of the UFO propulsion system. It acts like a powerful electromagnet attracting iron containing particulates in the soil.\nOther elements (phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium, boron, manganese, copper, zinc, aluminum) also trend higher for site samples 1, 2, 3 and 5. Site sample 4 appears to be an outlier with lesser amounts of phosphorus, calcium, manganese, copper, zinc and aluminum compared to the controls. Sodium and sulfur values are \"all over the map\".\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd.

This is an excellent technique for identification of crystalline material. The mineral contents of both samples are the same.

This would indicate some chemical changes in the site samples. The detection of the difference in cationic activity in the soil is intriguing. However, compositional differences, e.g. such as clay (microcline) content may affect the CEC values. (The amounts of minerals were not determined.) It very speculative that the effect is due to a UFO because the samples were collected 40 years after the event. But, it should be noted that this laboratory has analyzed substances from other events which were in proximity to a UFO. And, there is indication that while hovering an electronic force field surrounds the craft causing an ionizing effect to materials in close proximity. For example, in the famous Delphos Kansas event, a craft was observed depositing mostly fulvic acids which chemilumenesced for almost two days. In Poland, a hovering/landed craft deposited vitrified soil chunks which glowed for months.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 12\nSome of the measurements have values (pH, Estimated Nitrogen Release) that correlate with the Organic Matter (humus) content. Expectedly there is a lower pH (more acetic) and more nitrogen release with higher humus content. The phosphorus values are all over the place. Evaluation of the remaining data shows no conclusive correlation to the site samples. This is not surprising after 40 years. Still it was \"worth a shot\". (We feel the results would have shown something if the soil samples had been collected right after the event.)\nMetal Particulates Analysis\n\"Magnetic Drag\"\nThe \"Magnetic Drag\" analysis for determining the amounts of metal particulates was very informative, and showed the site samples clearly contain more metal particulates than the controls. Furthermore the metal particulates trend to have higher concentrations in the surface soil (top 2 inches) than the bottom sampling. The amount of particulates in sample 2 is close to the two controls which suggest the possibility the craft was not influencing the metal content as much at this location.

Magnetite, for example, is a common igneous accessory mineral and found in sedimentary banded iron formations.12 According to the literature, other metal impurities in magnetite may be magnesium, zinc, manganese, nickel, chromium, titanium, vanadium and aluminum, depending on the location where it's found. It should be noted that residual minerals (quartz/clay (montmorillonite)) from the soil appear to be part of the metal particle composite, i.e. infused in the metal particulates. After all the washing, this analyst went over the particles, again and again, with a magnet. They were all attracted. No other particles were magnetic.\nOne analyst13 offered that the metal particles originate from fly ash. He projected that this material would be expected to cover the Earth, especially starting from the introduction of the industrial era. The composition of these ashes varies depending on the processes that they originated from. Analyses reported in the literature for fly ash\n12Magnetite mineral information and data, http://wwwmindat.org/min-2538.html.\nNick Reiter, Personal Communication.\nT. S. R. No .: UT095 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 16\nare not commensurate with this analysis.14 A number of metal oxides are found in fly ashes which are not in the Travis Walton site particulates.\nThere is also some conjecture that metal particulates from sites exposed to UFO activity are of meteoric origin. There is a theory which involves a \"descending ionosphere plasma\". The plasma, which originates in the ionosphere, brings meteoric dust to the ground. That is, this meteoric dust is drawn into the descending plasma system by strong magnetic fields. The strong magnetic field could be generated by a UFO propulsion system.15 However, the elemental data of particulates from this analysis do not compare to those reported for most meteorites. For example, there is only a trace of nickel. This value should be much higher if the particulates were meteoric dust. 16 An excellent Washington University in St. Louis article reports, \"About 95% of all meteorites contain iron- nickel (FeNi) metal. Iron-Nickel means that the metal is mostly iron, but it contains 4-30% nickel, as well as a few tenths of a percent cobalt. Iron-Nickel in meteorites also has high concentrations (by terrestrial standards) of rare metals like gold, platinum and iridium.\" The common chondrite meteorites account for 86% of all meteorites recovered. 17\nFile: UT095\nPhyllis A.

The witness, who was quite upset after the incident, called her daughter soon after it occurred. She gave her daughter a lot of details on the phone and her daughter proceeded to write them down.Her daughter had brought along her note pad and shared that information with me. I had the chance to talk with the witness in detail and later that day, I went with the witness and another relative to the sighting location just a short distance outside of West Newton. I searched the immediate area, but nothing unusual was observed.Continue scrolling for more...The incident occurred during the evening on a rural road just a short distance from West Newton. The woman was driving about 35 miles per hour and traveling towards West Newton. As she drove along the stretch, on the passenger side of the road to her right, she saw a tall dark figure come out of a clearing and walk up on the road just as she was about to pass that area. She slowed down to look and saw the creature was at the passenger side of the car. What she saw stood approximately 7 feet tall. It was covered with long brownish-red hair. The arms were long and skinny.What frightened her the most were its large shiny red eyes that seemed to be luminous. The creature was looking into the passenger side window at her. The woman told me she was very frightened and hit the gas and sped down the road to get away from the creature. The witness mentioned that she doesn’t like scary things and had no interest in Bigfoot or watching such TV programs about the creature. She also stated, “I never thought it would happen to me.”AddendumThe West Newton area and other nearby Westmoreland County communities have had a long history of Bigfoot encounters. In the late 1960s, local residents reported encountering the “Lowber Monster.”  A white hair covered creature was reported by locals and strange footprints were found.

Medich MD\nAssistant Director\nMUFON ERT\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nA specimen which included a small fiber was removed from the back of an Experiencer on April 4, 2012. There is also a crystalline material included with the specimen. The object is to determine the composition of the specimen and crystal, and whether it could be related to an alien implant. Another specimen from the same experiencer was recently analyzed.1\nConclusions:\n. The specimen is a multi-component mixture. In order of approximate concentration these include calcium carbonate (calcite), ester type material (possible glycerol type or sorbitan monooleate) and quartz. Visually noted is a fiber which is a minor part of the specimen. It could not be identified because of the interference of the other components. However, it is speculated to be of plant origin.\n. The crystal is identified as sucrose which is commonly known as sugar.\n. The specimen and crystal are not related to an alien implant. The above components are very common with many uses. Quartz (possible sand) and calcium carbonate (calcite) are common minerals in soil. There are other uses. The ester appears to be of natural origin, i.e. it's commonly found in plants, human respiratory products, animals.\n1 Frontier Analysis TSR No .: UT091\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nThe sample was received on March 10, 2016, submitted in a small resealable plastic bag labeled \"4/14/2012 from back\".\nInfrared2 spectra were obtained from the specimen and crystal on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Photographs were also obtained from the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\nResults:\nA microscope photograph obtained of the specimen next to a ruler graduated in millimeters shows the specimen is about 2 mm in length and less than 0.5 mm wide. There is a fibrous material which is a minor component of the specimen and appears to be less than 0.1 mm thickness. The photograph follows.\nThe Specimen\nA photograph of a crystalline material shows it is cube shaped and has no color. It is very small at about 0.5 mm. Following are two photographs showing the crystal next to a ruler (millimeter) and a close up view.\nThe Crystal\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nThe infrared spectrum of the specimen shows it is composed of four or more components. Identified are calcium carbonate (calcite) and quartz. Both could be mineral components of soil/sand. There is also a significant amount of a long chain ester, which more specifically could be a glycerol type derivative or similar to sorbitan monooleate. The fiber absorption bands are masked by those of the other components so could not be specifically identified. It is pure speculation, but it could be plant derived. Following is the spectrum with components identified.\nInfrared Spectrum of the Specimen\n100\n98\n96\n94\n92\nQ\n90\nC\nEE\n88\nQ\nE\nE\n86\n84\n%T\n82\nC\nE\n80\nE\nC\n78\n76\nC - CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCITE)\nQ\nQ - QUARTZ\n74\n72\n70\nE - LONG CHAIN ESTER\n68\n(POSSIBLE GLYCEROL OR SORBATIN MONOOLEATE TYPE)\n66\n3000\n2000\n1 500\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n1000\n500\nInfrared analysis of the crystal definitely identifies it as sucrose also known as sugar.

Medich MD\nAssistant Director\nMUFON ERT\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nA specimen which included a small fiber was removed from the back of an Experiencer on April 4, 2012. There is also a crystalline material included with the specimen. The object is to determine the composition of the specimen and crystal, and whether it could be related to an alien implant. Another specimen from the same experiencer was recently analyzed.1\nConclusions:\n. The specimen is a multi-component mixture. In order of approximate concentration these include calcium carbonate (calcite), ester type material (possible glycerol type or sorbitan monooleate) and quartz. Visually noted is a fiber which is a minor part of the specimen. It could not be identified because of the interference of the other components. However, it is speculated to be of plant origin.\n. The crystal is identified as sucrose which is commonly known as sugar.\n. The specimen and crystal are not related to an alien implant. The above components are very common with many uses. Quartz (possible sand) and calcium carbonate (calcite) are common minerals in soil. There are other uses. The ester appears to be of natural origin, i.e. it's commonly found in plants, human respiratory products, animals.\n1 Frontier Analysis TSR No .: UT091\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nThe sample was received on March 10, 2016, submitted in a small resealable plastic bag labeled \"4/14/2012 from back\".\nInfrared2 spectra were obtained from the specimen and crystal on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Photographs were also obtained from the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\nResults:\nA microscope photograph obtained of the specimen next to a ruler graduated in millimeters shows the specimen is about 2 mm in length and less than 0.5 mm wide. There is a fibrous material which is a minor component of the specimen and appears to be less than 0.1 mm thickness. The photograph follows.\nThe Specimen\nA photograph of a crystalline material shows it is cube shaped and has no color. It is very small at about 0.5 mm. Following are two photographs showing the crystal next to a ruler (millimeter) and a close up view.\nThe Crystal\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nThe infrared spectrum of the specimen shows it is composed of four or more components. Identified are calcium carbonate (calcite) and quartz. Both could be mineral components of soil/sand. There is also a significant amount of a long chain ester, which more specifically could be a glycerol type derivative or similar to sorbitan monooleate. The fiber absorption bands are masked by those of the other components so could not be specifically identified. It is pure speculation, but it could be plant derived.

Medich MD\nAssistant Director\nMUFON ERT\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nA specimen which included a small fiber was removed from the back of an Experiencer on April 4, 2012. There is also a crystalline material included with the specimen. The object is to determine the composition of the specimen and crystal, and whether it could be related to an alien implant. Another specimen from the same experiencer was recently analyzed.1\nConclusions:\n. The specimen is a multi-component mixture. In order of approximate concentration these include calcium carbonate (calcite), ester type material (possible glycerol type or sorbitan monooleate) and quartz. Visually noted is a fiber which is a minor part of the specimen. It could not be identified because of the interference of the other components. However, it is speculated to be of plant origin.\n. The crystal is identified as sucrose which is commonly known as sugar.\n. The specimen and crystal are not related to an alien implant. The above components are very common with many uses. Quartz (possible sand) and calcium carbonate (calcite) are common minerals in soil. There are other uses. The ester appears to be of natural origin, i.e. it's commonly found in plants, human respiratory products, animals.\n1 Frontier Analysis TSR No .: UT091\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nThe sample was received on March 10, 2016, submitted in a small resealable plastic bag labeled \"4/14/2012 from back\".\nInfrared2 spectra were obtained from the specimen and crystal on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Photographs were also obtained from the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\nResults:\nA microscope photograph obtained of the specimen next to a ruler graduated in millimeters shows the specimen is about 2 mm in length and less than 0.5 mm wide. There is a fibrous material which is a minor component of the specimen and appears to be less than 0.1 mm thickness. The photograph follows.\nThe Specimen\nA photograph of a crystalline material shows it is cube shaped and has no color. It is very small at about 0.5 mm. Following are two photographs showing the crystal next to a ruler (millimeter) and a close up view.\nThe Crystal\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nThe infrared spectrum of the specimen shows it is composed of four or more components. Identified are calcium carbonate (calcite) and quartz. Both could be mineral components of soil/sand. There is also a significant amount of a long chain ester, which more specifically could be a glycerol type derivative or similar to sorbitan monooleate. The fiber absorption bands are masked by those of the other components so could not be specifically identified. It is pure speculation, but it could be plant derived. Following is the spectrum with components identified.\nInfrared Spectrum of the Specimen\n100\n98\n96\n94\n92\nQ\n90\nC\nEE\n88\nQ\nE\nE\n86\n84\n%T\n82\nC\nE\n80\nE\nC\n78\n76\nC - CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCITE)\nQ\nQ - QUARTZ\n74\n72\n70\nE - LONG CHAIN ESTER\n68\n(POSSIBLE GLYCEROL OR SORBATIN MONOOLEATE TYPE)\n66\n3000\n2000\n1 500\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n1000\n500\nInfrared analysis of the crystal definitely identifies it as sucrose also known as sugar.

Medich MD\nAssistant Director\nMUFON ERT\nReported By:\nP. A. Budinger\nAnalytical Scientist\nA specimen which included a small fiber was removed from the back of an Experiencer on April 4, 2012. There is also a crystalline material included with the specimen. The object is to determine the composition of the specimen and crystal, and whether it could be related to an alien implant. Another specimen from the same experiencer was recently analyzed.1\nConclusions:\n. The specimen is a multi-component mixture. In order of approximate concentration these include calcium carbonate (calcite), ester type material (possible glycerol type or sorbitan monooleate) and quartz. Visually noted is a fiber which is a minor part of the specimen. It could not be identified because of the interference of the other components. However, it is speculated to be of plant origin.\n. The crystal is identified as sucrose which is commonly known as sugar.\n. The specimen and crystal are not related to an alien implant. The above components are very common with many uses. Quartz (possible sand) and calcium carbonate (calcite) are common minerals in soil. There are other uses. The ester appears to be of natural origin, i.e. it's commonly found in plants, human respiratory products, animals.\n1 Frontier Analysis TSR No .: UT091\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 2\nProcedure:\nThe sample was received on March 10, 2016, submitted in a small resealable plastic bag labeled \"4/14/2012 from back\".\nInfrared2 spectra were obtained from the specimen and crystal on the Thermo Electron Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Smart Herrick diamond sampling accessory. Photographs were also obtained from the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope interfaced to a Canon A520 digital camera.\nResults:\nA microscope photograph obtained of the specimen next to a ruler graduated in millimeters shows the specimen is about 2 mm in length and less than 0.5 mm wide. There is a fibrous material which is a minor component of the specimen and appears to be less than 0.1 mm thickness. The photograph follows.\nThe Specimen\nA photograph of a crystalline material shows it is cube shaped and has no color. It is very small at about 0.5 mm. Following are two photographs showing the crystal next to a ruler (millimeter) and a close up view.\nThe Crystal\n2 FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy): Infrared spectroscopy is used for the molecular structure identification and quantification of solids, liquids, and gases. An infrared spectrum is the result of light (in the 2 to 25 micron wavelength range) interacting with the vibrations of molecules. The particular set of vibrations of a molecule gives rise to specific spectral absorption bands, often referred to as the \"fingerprint\" spectrum.\nT. S. R. No .: UT092 Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Page 3\nThe infrared spectrum of the specimen shows it is composed of four or more components. Identified are calcium carbonate (calcite) and quartz. Both could be mineral components of soil/sand. There is also a significant amount of a long chain ester, which more specifically could be a glycerol type derivative or similar to sorbitan monooleate. The fiber absorption bands are masked by those of the other components so could not be specifically identified. It is pure speculation, but it could be plant derived. Following is the spectrum with components identified.\nInfrared Spectrum of the Specimen\n100\n98\n96\n94\n92\nQ\n90\nC\nEE\n88\nQ\nE\nE\n86\n84\n%T\n82\nC\nE\n80\nE\nC\n78\n76\nC - CALCIUM CARBONATE (CALCITE)\nQ\nQ - QUARTZ\n74\n72\n70\nE - LONG CHAIN ESTER\n68\n(POSSIBLE GLYCEROL OR SORBATIN MONOOLEATE TYPE)\n66\n3000\n2000\n1 500\nWavenumbers (cm-1)\n1000\n500\nInfrared analysis of the crystal definitely identifies it as sucrose also known as sugar.

    "content": "Witness believes this case is solved. See Below.The following was submitted to The Black Vault. It is used here with permission. Please note, the video does not have the correct date on the window burn due to incorrect settings.Witness SummaryThis video was made with a Luna Optics color night vision camera LN-DM50-HRSD.It is 5X but can go to 20X. This was approx. at 9:00 on July 4th, 2015 at the Sabino Canyon parking lot situated in the northeast edge of Tucson. I’ve always left the time stamp of my videos at its original 2011 so ignore that. The sky was completely overcast over the Catalina Mtns. The small dots you see on the screen are normal for night vision cameras and are not stars in the sky.The very first couple of seconds shows some odd lights in the right of the frame. Those are the radio towers on the mountain out of focus thus making them look odd.Continue scrolling for more...There were a few cars coming and and going out of the parking lot and they account for some of the light shifts. Unfortunately I zoomed in too much and it destroyed the clarity of the video but it still captures the amazing event that we witnessed.There are a couple of times I adjust the focus and it makes the 3 lights of the UFO seem to morph but that is only, again, me focusing. The main 3 lights stayed distinct in the sky and only look like they become one light and then back to 3 because of my tinkering.The eyewitness also submitted a corroborating video, from a friend, who also shot the same event. Here is the video:Note from The Black VaultAfter seeing the radio towers in the daylight video, I went ahead and asked the witness for clarification, to ensure the lights were not around the radio tower itself.  This was his response:The radio towers are approx. 8 to 10 miles away from where we videoed. The UFO had to have been at least 30 miles away to be in that good of a focus since airplanes 8 to 10 away require me to adjust my focus. The radio tower lights are way out of focus and yet the UFO is in focus since I leave my lens at a setting that on this particular camera has stars, satellites and far off planes in focus without me having to change the focal setting. The radio tower light can only be seen in the first couple seconds of the video to the far right edge of the frame. Hope that helps but if not please ask for more clarification.Details on the LocationThe following was submitted by the eyewitness, to better explain the location of the sighting:Click for a higher resolution photo.The radio towers are on Mt. Bigelow that just a part of the greater Catalina Range and the towers are now confirmed to be about 8 miles from the parking lot at Sabino. Panoramio – Photo of Mt. Bigelow Broadcast Tower Site, East of Tucson, Az Bigelow is just to the left of Willow Canyon on the following map and the pointer at the end of the red line is likely where the UFO was way out in the middle of desert wilderness. It may have been closer but it was certainly beyond the mountain range.

There has been much speculation and investigation, and it is possible, though he won’t say with absolute certainty, that this is resolved. The letter read as follows:After going up on the mountain itself 3 times and doing a lot of figuring things out to a rational conclusion, it looks like our now infamous 4th of July videos were of human origin.  The one and only place the lights could have been was only a few yards long and they would have to be motorcycles since cars couldn’t have parked on that narrow a road.  They were showing their headlights down to their buddies below who were watching the fireworks and using green and blue lasers to augment their position.  They were probably in cellphone contact as well since that is a cell hot area up there.  It sure made for a beautiful UFO video too good to be true it seems.  MUFON only did a partial investigation and then only assumed it was vehicle lights but never pegged exactly where they were so I was not pleased with them calling it “case closed”.Everyone I know still thinks this was a UFO event even though I’ve presented the evidence otherwise.  I’ll leave a 1% chance of it being ET oriented just in case.  Ha!  Here’s the webpage where I finally solved all the anomaliesMore Evidnece – Getting to the Truth, Tucson UFO Video July 4, 15Thanks again John for your open minded position.  —TomOn August 12, 2016, I received the below email, which puts the case to rest that the witness no longer believes it is a UFO:Hope all is well.  Regarding our infamous July 4th video of 2015, we went to Sabino Canyon on July 4th 2016 and saw pretty much the same light configurations on Mt.

    "all_content": "Witness believes this case is solved. See Below.The following was submitted to The Black Vault. It is used here with permission. Please note, the video does not have the correct date on the window burn due to incorrect settings.Witness SummaryThis video was made with a Luna Optics color night vision camera LN-DM50-HRSD.It is 5X but can go to 20X. This was approx. at 9:00 on July 4th, 2015 at the Sabino Canyon parking lot situated in the northeast edge of Tucson. I’ve always left the time stamp of my videos at its original 2011 so ignore that. The sky was completely overcast over the Catalina Mtns. The small dots you see on the screen are normal for night vision cameras and are not stars in the sky.The very first couple of seconds shows some odd lights in the right of the frame. Those are the radio towers on the mountain out of focus thus making them look odd.Continue scrolling for more...There were a few cars coming and and going out of the parking lot and they account for some of the light shifts. Unfortunately I zoomed in too much and it destroyed the clarity of the video but it still captures the amazing event that we witnessed.There are a couple of times I adjust the focus and it makes the 3 lights of the UFO seem to morph but that is only, again, me focusing. The main 3 lights stayed distinct in the sky and only look like they become one light and then back to 3 because of my tinkering.The eyewitness also submitted a corroborating video, from a friend, who also shot the same event. Here is the video:Note from The Black VaultAfter seeing the radio towers in the daylight video, I went ahead and asked the witness for clarification, to ensure the lights were not around the radio tower itself.  This was his response:The radio towers are approx. 8 to 10 miles away from where we videoed. The UFO had to have been at least 30 miles away to be in that good of a focus since airplanes 8 to 10 away require me to adjust my focus. The radio tower lights are way out of focus and yet the UFO is in focus since I leave my lens at a setting that on this particular camera has stars, satellites and far off planes in focus without me having to change the focal setting. The radio tower light can only be seen in the first couple seconds of the video to the far right edge of the frame. Hope that helps but if not please ask for more clarification.Details on the LocationThe following was submitted by the eyewitness, to better explain the location of the sighting:Click for a higher resolution photo.The radio towers are on Mt. Bigelow that just a part of the greater Catalina Range and the towers are now confirmed to be about 8 miles from the parking lot at Sabino. Panoramio – Photo of Mt. Bigelow Broadcast Tower Site, East of Tucson, Az Bigelow is just to the left of Willow Canyon on the following map and the pointer at the end of the red line is likely where the UFO was way out in the middle of desert wilderness. It may have been closer but it was certainly beyond the mountain range.

It is republished here with permission:Date of Sighting:June 20, 1987Time of Sighting:12:15 PM Local TimeDate Reported:April 3, 2006Duration of Sighting:UnknownLocation of Sighting:Cedar Point, Ontario, Canada (Southern Ontario)Latitude:44.8 Degrees NorthLongitude:80.18  Degrees WestNumber of Witnesses:OneWeather:Clear Skies.Description (In Witness’s Own Words):The sighting occurred near Cedar Point, Ontario, Canada. I was flying my Citabria airplane at 3500 ft. ASL. The dull silver saucer shaped UFO was first sited over Christian Island as I was banking my aircraft to the right on a level turn. I opened my left side window to watch as theUFO passed approximately 500 ft. underneath my plane.I then banked the plane to the left so that I would not lose sight of it.The UFO continued on a straight and level path, and although I was going 110 m.p,h. the UFO’s speed was such that there was no way I could catch up to it. If I had to approximate it’s speed, I would guess at 400-600 m.p.h. As for the size of the UFO, I can’t really say, since there was nothing that I could compare it to. If I had to guess, I would say about 30 to 50 feet in diameter. It happened so quickly, but I did get a very good look at it.Continue scrolling for more...There were no windows or any markings on the UFO. The color was a dull silver, almost a grey color. I usually always carry a camera in my side pouch, but this time, it was in a bag behind the rear passenger seat. If I had a passenger with me at that time, I would have been able to get a very good picture with my 35mm camera!Now when I go flying, I always make sure that I have at least two cameras with me at all times.Addition Information About Airplane Pilot Was Flying:The aircraft was manufactured by Champion Aircraft CO. in the USA.  The model is a Citabria 7ECA.Investigator’s Notes:This is an example of a credible witness reporting an incredible sighting.  The witness did not report this sighting previously because he was afraid of ridicule.He got a good look at the craft as it approached close to his aircraft.  The sighting occurred near the middle of a bright sunny day.Not much more to say:Unidentified!codepeople-post-map require JavaScriptFollow The Black Vault on Social Media:Share on FacebookTweetSave",
