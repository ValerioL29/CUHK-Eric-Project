The Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us in the manner provided in Section 4.3 of this Agreement by the fifteenth(15 th ) day of each calendar month based on royalty fees generated and received during the previous calendar month.   4.2.2 You shall pay to us a franchise sales royalty fee (the \"Franchise Sales Royalty Fee\") for each Unit Franchise you sell in the Master Territory as follows: twenty-five percent (25%) of the initial franchise fee collected from each Unit Franchisee upon execution of the Unit Franchisee's Franchise Agreement (a \"Unit Franchise Agreement\"); provided, however, that if you elect to discount or reduce an initial franchise fee for any reason, the Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be payable to us as if the full initial franchise fee had been paid. The Franchise Sales Royalty Fee shall be paid by you to us at the same time and in the same manner as the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee provided in Section 4.2.1 above. Any Royalty Fee you collect from the Franchisee shall be immediately paid to Us, but no later than the fifteen (15  th ) day of each calendar month. A Unit Franchise shall be deemed to be sold to a Unit Franchisee on the date that you and the Unit Franchisee execute the Unit Franchise Agreement, irrespective of when the Unit Franchise begins operation. Fees and Royalties cannot be increased or decreased without our prior written consent.\n\n4\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.2.3 In addition to the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee and Franchise Sales Royalty Fee described above, you shall collect from each Unit Franchisee in your Master Territory a \"National Advertising Fund Contribution\" to be contributed to our \"National Advertising Fund\" pursuant to the terms of the individual Unit Franchise Agreements. For each Unit Franchise you own and operate, you shall pay the National Advertising Fund Contribution on the same basis as Unit Franchisees. The National Advertising Fund Contribution shall be collected by you from each Unit Franchisee and spent by you in accordance with the agreement on behalf of the franchisor and Franchisees.   4.3 Manner of Payment   You shall pay us all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees and Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, due under this Section 4 by electronic funds transfer by us against a bank account maintained by you. You agree to execute the documents required by us, our bank and/or your bank in order to permit us to conduct electronic funds transfers to and from your account, and you shall not close your account without our prior consent. Your failure to comply with the terms of this Section 4.3 shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement. You hereby authorize us to initiate debit entries and/or credit collection entries to your bank account for the payment of Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you. You shall make funds available for withdrawal by us by electronic transfer on such dates of each month as we shall designate throughout the term of this Agreement.   If you fail to provide the revenue reports described in Section 4.6 below, then in addition to the late fee described in such Section, we may debit your account for one hundred forty percent (140%) of the last Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution (as applicable) that we debited. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are less than the fees you actually owe us, once we have been able to determine the true and correct revenue amounts, we will debit your account for the balance on a day we specify. If the Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fee, Franchise Sales Royalty Fee and/or National Advertising Fund Contribution we debit are greater than the fees you actually owe us, we will credit the excess against the amount we otherwise would debit from your account for the next payment due.   4.4 Interest on Overdue Amounts   Any payment not actually received by us on or before the Fifteen (15 th ) day of each month (or the next business day if the Fifteen(15 th ) of any month is not a business day) shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay to us, in addition to the overdue payment, interest on such overdue amount at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Interest shall accrue from the original due date until payment is received in full. Our right to such interest shall be in addition to any other remedies we may have, including, without limitation, the right of set-off to withdraw or retain, from time to time and without notice to you, any amounts due and unpaid by us to you. You shall not be entitled to set-off any payments required to be made under this Section 4 against any monetary claim you may have against us.\n\n5\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.5 Late Fee; Insufficient Funds Fee   In the event you fail to provide us with any report we require on or before the date we require it, you agree to pay to us a late fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). In addition, if, for any reason, any payment owed by you to us is denied by your bank due to insufficient funds in your account, then you shall, in addition to applicable interest as described in Section 4.4 above, pay us an insufficient funds fee in the amount of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($250). If you incur three (3) late fees or insufficient funds fees within any twelve (12) month period, we will have the right to terminate this Agreement without providing you an opportunity to cure the default.   4.6 Unit Franchise Agreements and Revenue Reports   You shall submit to us copies of all Unit Franchise Agreements executed with Unit Franchisees within ten (10) days of the date of their execution, together with a copy of all checks presented to you at closing. You shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, not later than the first (1 s t ) day of each month, of Franchise Sales Revenue generated by you during the previous calendar month. Contemporaneously with the submission of the Franchise Sales Revenue report, you shall prepare and submit to us a monthly report, in such form and including such detail as we require, reflecting royalty fees paid and owed to you by your Unit Franchisees for the previous calendar month. Any report not actually received by us when due shall be deemed overdue and you shall pay us a late charge as described above.   4.7 Security Interest   In order to secure payment of all Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, and all other sums that may become due to us or our affiliates from you under this Agreement, and to secure your performance of all obligations of any kind, whenever and however incurred, in favor of us or our affiliates:   4.7.1 You hereby grant us a security interest in and to all equipment, furniture, fixtures, inventory, supplies and vehicles used in connection with the Franchised Business, now or hereafter acquired by you, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all of your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights. You hereby authorize us to prepare and file all Uniform Commercial Code (\"UCC\") financing statements and other documents necessary or desirable to evidence, perfect and continue the priority of this security interest under the UCC.   4.7.2 If you are and remain in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements with us and our affiliates, we will consent to your grant of an additional security interest in the Franchised Business or in any of the assets of the Franchised Business if the conditions set forth in Section 12.4 of this Agreement are met.   4.7.3 If you are in default of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other agreements between us and our affiliates and you, we may, in our sole and absolute discretion, exercise our rights with respect to our security interest. In such event, you shall be and remain liable for any deficiency remaining due to us and shall be entitled to recover any surplus which results after application of the proceeds derived from the enforcement of our security interest.\n\n6\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  4.8 Reimbursement of Monies   You shall pay to us, within fifteen (15) days of any written request by us accompanied by reasonable substantiating material, any monies which we have paid, or have become obligated to pay, on your behalf by consent or otherwise under this Agreement.   4.9 Application of Fees   Notwithstanding any designation by you, we shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments made by you to any past due indebtedness of yours for Unit Franchise Performance Royalty Fees, Franchise Sales Royalty Fees, National Advertising Fund Contributions, or any other indebtedness, in such amounts and in such order as we shall determine.   5.

In the event of termination for any default of yours, such sums shall include all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us as a result of the default, which obligation shall give rise to and remain, until paid in full, a lien in our favor against any and all leasehold improvements, fixtures, furnishings and equipment, inventory, supplies and vehicles located at or used in connection with the Franchised Business, together with all accounts, payment intangibles, attachments, accessories, additions, substitutions and replacements, all cash and non-cash proceeds derived from insurance or the disposition of such assets, all your rights to use the Proprietary Marks, patents, copyrights and their registrations, trade secret information and other proprietary rights, and all rights granted, owned or licensed to you under this Agreement for the use of the Proprietary Marks, trade names, trade styles, patents, copyrights, trade secret information and other proprietary rights.

The parties hereto consider this liquidated damages provision to be a reasonable, good faith pre-estimate of those damages.   11.4.4 The liquidated damages provision only covers our damages from the loss of cash flow from the Royalty Fees. It does not cover any other damages, including damages to our reputation with the public and landlords and damages arising from a violation of any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections. You and each of your principals agree that the liquidated damages provision does not give us an adequate remedy at law for any default under, or for the enforcement of, any provision of this Agreement other than the Royalty Fee sections.\n\n26\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  11.5 Costs to Secure Compliance   You shall pay to us all damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us prior or subsequent to the termination or expiration of the franchise herein granted in obtaining injunctive or other relief for the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 11.   11.6 Return of Manuals and Other Confidential Information   You shall immediately deliver to us the Manuals and all other records, correspondence, files, and any instructions containing confidential information relating to the operation of the Franchised Business which are in your possession, and all copies thereof, all of which are acknowledged to be our property.   11.7 Irreparable Injury to Us   You agree and acknowledge that your failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 11 will result in irreparable harm to us and to the Proprietary Marks, and you agree to pay all damages, expenses, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by us in obtaining specific performance of, or an injunction against violation of, and/or damages resulting from a violation of, the requirements of this Section 11.   11.8 Compliance with Post-Term Covenants   All of your covenants, obligations, and agreements which by their terms or by reasonable implication are to be performed, in whole or in part, after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall survive such termination or expiration.   12.

Our consent or refusal to consent may be based upon whatever factors we, in our sole discretion, deem economically and commercially reasonable in protecting our interests and security interest under this Agreement and the relationship created under this Agreement; however, if you are in good standing under this Agreement and all other agreements between us or our affiliates and you, we shall, upon your written request, execute a written subordination of our security interest to lenders and/or lessors providing financing for the Franchised Business. Under any circumstances however, we shall not consent to any such granting of a security interest unless all of the following conditions are met:   12.3.1 Such security is granted only for the purpose of securing a loan in your favor, which loan shall only be for the benefit of the Franchised Business.   12.3.2 In the event of any default by you under any documents in any way relating to the security interest or the loan to which it relates, we shall have the right at our sole option (but not the obligation) to cure any such default and/or to be substituted as obligor to the lender whose interests are secured by such security interest.   12.3.3 In the event of any such default, and if we choose to be substituted as obligor, we shall be so substituted in all respects on the same terms and conditions to which you were subject, except that any acceleration of the obligations secured, due to your default, shall be void upon cure by us.   12.3.4 Such other conditions and terms as we shall deem necessary and/or prudent to protect our interests under this Agreement.   12.4 Transfer Upon Death or Disability   Upon the death or permanent disability (mental or physical) of any person with an interest in this Agreement, in you, or in all or substantially all of the assets of the Franchised Business, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of such person shall transfer such interest to a third party approved by us within twelve (12) months after such death or disability. Such transfers, including, without limitation, transfers by devise or inheritance, shall be subject to the same conditions as any inter vivos transfer, except that the transfer fee shall be waived. In the case of transfer by devise or inheritance, however, if the heirs or beneficiaries of any such person are unable to meet the conditions of this Section 12, the executor, administrator, or personal representative of the decedent shall transfer the decedent's interest to another party approved by us within twelve (12) months, which disposition shall be subject to all the terms and conditions for transfers contained in this Agreement. We may, at our option, assume management and control of the Franchised Business during such twelve (12) month period and shall be paid a reasonable monthly management fee for our services as determined by us. If the interest is not disposed of within such period, we may, at our option, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2.4 of this Agreement.\n\n28\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  12.5 Non-Waiver of Claims   Our consent to a transfer shall not constitute a waiver of any claims we may have against the transferring party, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with any of the terms of this Agreement by the transferor or transferee.   12.6 Transfer by You in Bankruptcy - Right of First Refusal   If, for any reason, this Agreement is not terminated pursuant to Section 10.1 and this Agreement is assumed, or assignment of the same to any person or entity who has made a bona fide offer to accept an assignment of this Agreement is contemplated pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code, then notice of such proposed assignment or assumption setting forth: (a) the name and address of the proposed assignee, and (b) all of the terms and conditions of the proposed assignment and assumption shall be given to us within twenty (20) days after receipt of such proposed assignee's offer to accept assignment of this Agreement, and, in any event, within ten (10) days prior to the date application is made to a court of competent jurisdiction for authority and approval to enter into such assignment and assumption, and we shall thereupon have the prior right and option, to be exercised by notice given at any time prior to the effective date of such proposed assignment and assumption, to accept an assignment of this Agreement to us upon the same terms and conditions and for the same consideration, if any, as in the bona fide offer made by the proposed assignee, less any brokerage commissions which may be payable by you out of the consideration to be paid by such assignee for the assignment of this Agreement.   13.

You shall include in the standard Unit Franchise Agreement used by you a provision which states that we are a third-party beneficiary to the Unit Franchise Agreement and are entitled to the rights granted in this Section 13.

Your failure to exercise the proper diligence in enforcing the terms of any Unit Franchise Agreement and to insure the appropriate monitoring and use of the Proprietary Marks shall constitute a default under the terms of this Agreement which may result in termination of this Agreement.   13.4 Effect of Termination of this Agreement   In the event this Agreement is terminated or expires prior to the end of the term of this Agreement, those portions of this Agreement which pertain to and apply to any Unit Franchise Agreement will continue in full force and effect, but only with regard to those Unit Franchise Agreements which have been entered into and were in effect prior to the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement.   13.5 Unit Franchise Refund Policy   You shall comply with our requirements related to a Unit Franchisee's right to terminate its Unit Franchise Agreement according to the terms of such Unit Franchise Agreement, if any, as well as our policy regarding refunds of initial franchise fees to Unit Franchisees, if any.   14.

For the purpose of this Section 14.4, the term \"losses and expenses\" shall be deemed to include compensatory, exemplary, or punitive damages; fines and penalties; attorneys' fees; experts' fees; court costs; costs associated with investigating and defending against claims; settlement amounts; judgments; compensation for damages to our reputation and goodwill; and all other costs associated with any of the foregoing losses and expenses.

Any assumption of ours shall not modify your indemnification obligation. We may, in our sole judgment, take such actions as we deem necessary and appropriate to investigate, defend, or settle any event or take other remedial or corrective actions with respect thereto as may be, in our sole judgment, necessary for the protection of the Indemnitees or the System. You shall defend us and each of our affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents, and employees named in any lawsuit based on such loss or expenses and shall pay all costs and reasonable attorneys' fees associated with such defense. If we wish to retain our own counsel to defend any such action, you shall reimburse us for all reasonable costs and legal fees incurred by us for such defense. Said reimbursement shall be made to us in a timely manner upon demand as such fees are incurred by us and billed to you.\n\n31\n\nSource: SOUPMAN, INC., 8-K, 8/14/2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  15.

You acknowledge that you are entering into this Agreement, and any ancillary agreements executed contemporaneously herewith, as a result of your own independent investigation of the business franchised hereby and not as a result of any representation made by us or persons associated with us, or other franchisees, which are contrary to the terms herein set forth or which are contrary to the terms of any Franchise Disclosure Document or other similar document required or permitted to be given to you pursuant to applicable law. Except for those permitted under this Agreement to be made unilaterally by us, no amendment, change, or variation from this Agreement shall be binding on either party unless mutually agreed to by the parties and executed by their authorized officers or agents in writing.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n1.1 LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, PivX hereby grants to Detto a non-transferable, exclusive license to distribute PivX's Qwik-Fix Pro and any documentation supporting Qwik-Fix Pro provided from time to time by PivX (the \"Documentation\") within North America, solely to third parties to whom Detto licenses Qwik-Fix Pro (\"Third Parties\"), and as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A (PivX/Detto Reseller Agreement Addendum). PivX also hereby grants to Detto a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to distribute PivX's Qwik-Fix Pro and the Documentation outside of North America, solely to Third Parties and as governed by the terms in Exhibit A. Detto shall have no right to reproduce Qwik-Fix Pro or any part thereof. All copies of Qwik-Fix Pro distributed by Detto shall be distributed pursuant to PivX's current Enterprise License Agreement, as amended by PivX from time to time (the \"License\"), a copy of which PivX will provide Detto. Detto shall not distribute Qwik-Fix Pro to any Third Party unless the Third Party has accepted the terms of PivX's current License under penalty of perjury and in writing.\n\n1.2 OWNERSHIP.

Except as expressly granted herein, PivX does not grant to Detto any right or license, either express or implied, in Qwik-Fix Pro, Documentation or Property. Detto shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from Qwik-Fix Pro.\n\n1.3 PIVX CHANNELNET.

Detto's use of the Trademarks shall not create any right, title or interest therein. Detto shall use the Trademarks only in a manner which complies in all material respects with PivX's reasonable policies in effect from time to time, and all\n\n                                       1\n\nsuch use shall be for PivX's benefit. Detto shall not remove, obscure or alter PivX's copyright notice or the Trademarks from Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation. If Detto, in the course of distributing Qwik-Fix Pro, acquires any goodwill or reputation in any of the Trademarks, all such goodwill or reputation shall automatically be transferred to and shall vest in PivX when and as, on an on-going basis, such acquisition of goodwill or reputation occurs, as well as at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, without any separate payment or other consideration of any kind to Detto, and Detto agrees to take all such actions necessary to effect such vesting. Detto shall not contest the validity of any of the Property or PivX's exclusive ownership of them. Detto shall not adopt, use, or register, whether as a corporate name, trademark, service mark or other indication of origin, any of the Trademarks, or any word or mark confusingly similar to the Trademarks in any jurisdiction.\n\n2.3 SUPPORT FOR QWIK-FIX PRO. Detto shall provide for all customer support for Qwik-Fix Pro that it resells as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A.\n\n2.4 COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

In addition, Detto shall make its offices and equipment available in person, upon reasonable notice, and to the extent feasible, remotely, to PivX to inspect and test Detto's physical and technical set-up to ensure that Detto is complying with its obligations under this Section. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that Detto breaches its obligations under this Section 2.5.\n\n2.6 PROTECTION OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. Detto shall cooperate without charge (provided that PivX will reimburse out of pocket expenses as agreed in advance in writing), in PivX's efforts to protect PivX's rights in the Property. Detto shall promptly notify PivX of any infringements of PivX's Property Rights that come to Detto's attention. PivX shall have the exclusive right to institute infringement or other appropriate legal action against alleged infringers of its Property Rights. PivX shall incur all expenses in connection therewith and shall retain all monetary recoveries received therefrom.\n\n2.7 NO EXCESS REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES. Detto covenants that it shall not make any representations or warranties with respect to Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation in excess of those provided by PivX herein. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that Detto breaches its covenant under this Section 2.7.\n\n2.8 FULFILLMENT OF DETTO'S OBLIGATIONS. Detto covenants that it will fulfill all of its contractual and legal obligations to its customers. Detto covenants that it will (a) provide its customers with first quality sales and technical support with respect to any copies or licenses of Qwik-Fix Pro sold by Detto, (b) promptly, courteously and appropriately respond to its customers questions, concerns and complaints, and (c) generally deal with its customers in a professional manner that shall add to the good reputation of Detto and PivX. To the extent that Detto fails to fulfill its contractual and legal obligations to its customers, Detto agrees that PivX may elect to fulfill those obligations, or any portion of them, and Detto shall reimburse PivX any costs and expenses so incurred by PivX. Detto agrees to indemnify and hold PivX harmless in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.4 to the extent that it breaches any of its covenants under this Section 2.8.\n\n2.9 U.S. GOVERNMENT - RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Detto covenants to require its customers to accept a click-wrap agreement that, among other things, provides that Qwik-Fix Pro and accompanying documentation are deemed to be \"commercial computer Software\" and \"commercial computer Software documentation,\"\n\n                                       2\n\nrespectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212, as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction release, performance, display or disclosure of Qwik-Fix Pro and accompanying documentation by the U.S. Government shall be governed solely by the terms of the Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.\n\n2.10 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT. Detto will engage in future business development with PivX as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A.\n\n2.11 SALES FORECASTING; SALES METRICS; SALES REPORTING. Detto will provide sales forecasting, sales metrics and sales reporting to PivX as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A.\n\n3. PRICE AND PAYMENT; SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY\n\n3.1 SUGGESTED THIRD PARTY PRICES. Third Party prices are governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A.\n\n3.2 PER COPY FEES. Detto shall pay to PivX for each unit of Qwik-Fix Pro distributed hereunder per copy fees (the \"Per Copy Fees\") as governed by the terms set forth in Exhibit A. In the event that PivX changes the Third Party prices, Per Copy Fees based on such changed prices shall apply to any order for Qwik-Fix Pro received by PivX after the effective date of the increase. PivX shall provide Detto with at least forty-five (45) days written notice of any increase in the Per Copy Fees.\n\n3.3 PAYMENT. All payments to PivX shall be made within thirty (30) days after the receipt by Detto of the PivX's invoice. Detto shall pay PivX a late charge on outstanding amounts due equal to one and one-half percent (1.50%) per month or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less. All payments shall be made in United States Dollars, free of any withholding tax and of any currency control or other restrictions to PivX. PivX shall have the right, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, to inspect and audit the books and records of Detto to verify the accuracy of any statements. In the event that such an inspection discloses any error of any amount, the parties shall by appropriate payment promptly adjust for the error. If Detto fails to make payments when due, PivX shall be entitled to, in its sole discretion, to take any one or more of the following: (a) place Detto on credit hold, in which case, PivX may cease to fulfill Detto's orders to any new Third Parties; (b) rescind Detto's right to sell or distribute any additional Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation hereunder; and (c) to require that Detto direct all future payments, for licenses sold in the past or in the future, from the Third Parties directly to PivX or a lock box or\n\n\n\n\n\nan account designated by PivX for such purpose, to be applied by PivX to the payment default (and interest thereon) until such defaults have been satisfied. All amounts received by PivX hereunder shall be nonrefundable except for any payments received or held under PivX's control pursuant to clause \"c\" of the last sentence after Detto's payment default has been satisfied.\n\n3.4 TAXES, TARIFFS, FEES.

Should any tax or levy be made, Detto agrees to pay such tax or levy and indemnify PivX against any claim for such amount. Detto represents and warrants to PivX that all Qwik-Fix Pro acquired hereunder is for redistribution in the ordinary course of Detto's business, and Detto agrees to provide PivX with appropriate resale certificate numbers and other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of exemption from any such taxes or fees.\n\n3.5 SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY. PivX shall electronically deliver Qwik-Fix Pro to Detto. Detto shall inspect all software delivered to it, upon receipt and shall, within 10 days of receipt, give written notice to PivX of any claim of damage or missing portions. Should Detto fail to give such notice, or fail to obtain an extension of such 10-day period from PivX, the packages shall be deemed to be accepted by Detto. PivX will reasonably accommodate Detto's request to replace its master copy of software that becomes corrupted or damaged. Detto shall contractually require its Third Parties to report any claim of damage or shortages for Qwik-Fix Pro shipped to them within thirty (30) days of the Third Parties receipt of such package (or the time required by applicable law, if longer). PivX shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet delivery dates requested by Detto, but in no event shall PivX be liable for its failure to meet such dates. In the event that PivX shall be unable to meet Detto's requested ship dates, PivX shall advise Detto of the change in or actual delivery schedule.\n\n                                       3\n\n3.6 SECURITY INTEREST.

To secure its rights hereunder, PivX shall have the right to file one or more UCC financing statements and to make such other filings as PivX shall deem appropriate. Detto shall cooperate with PivX with respect to all such filings. Upon PivX's demand, Detto agrees to execute promptly any financing statement, security agreement, chattel mortgage, applications for registration and/or similar documents, and to take any other action deemed necessary for registration or otherwise deemed necessary or desirable by PivX in order to perfect PivX's security interest hereunder. In the event of Detto's default hereunder, PivX may foreclose its security interests and exercise such other rights as provided under the UCC.\n\n4. WARRANTY AND LIABILITY\n\n4.1 PRODUCT WARRANTY. With respect to Qwik-Fix Pro delivered by PivX to Detto on CD-Rom, PivX warrants that for a period of thirty (30) days following delivery to Detto, the media on which Qwik-Fix Pro is furnished to Detto will be free from defects in materials and workmanship during normal use.

PivX will indemnify, defend and hold Detto and its subsidiaries (each, an \"Indemnified Party\"), harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), arising as a result of or in connection with any claim that Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation infringes any intellectual property right of a third party provided: (i) the Indemnified Party promptly gives written notice of any claim to PivX; (ii) the Indemnified Party provides any assistance which PivX may reasonably request for the defense of the claim (with reasonable out of pocket expenses paid by PivX); and (iii) PivX has the right to control of the defense or settlement of the claim, provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, any litigation for which indemnification is sought with counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense. Additionally, if an injunction or order issues restricting the use or distribution of any of Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation, or if PivX determines that Qwik-Fix Pro or Documentation are likely to become the subject of a claim of infringement or violation of any proprietary right of any third party, PivX shall in its discretion and, at its option (a) procure the right to continue using, reproducing, and distributing Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation; (b) replace or modify Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation so that they become noninfringing, provided such modification or replacement does not materially alter or affect the specifications for or the use or operation of Qwik-Fix Pro; require return of Qwik-Fix Pro to PivX and refund any licensing fees relating to the future use of Qwik-Fix Pro.\n\n4.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR PIVX'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 4.2, IN NO EVENT SHALL PIVX'S OR ITS LICENSORS' LIABILITY TO DETTO OR ANY THIRD PARTY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY PIVX HEREUNDER DURING THE PREVIOUS SIX (6) MONTHS.

THIS LIMITATION SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN.\n\n                                       4\n\n4.4 INDEMNIFICATION. Detto shall indemnify and hold PivX harmless from and against any and all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) which PivX incurs as a result of any claim based on any breach of any representation or warranty, covenant or agreement by Detto under this Agreement or any breach of this Agreement by Detto; provided: (i) that PivX promptly gives written notice of any claim to Detto; (ii) at Detto's expense, PivX provides reasonable assistance which Detto may reasonably request for the defense of the claim; and (iii) Detto has the right to control the defense or settlement of the claim, provided, however, that PivX shall have the right to participate in, but not control, any litigation for which indemnification is sought with counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense.\n\n5. TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n5.1 TERM OF AGREEMENT. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for six (6) months.\n\n5.2 TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT. PivX may terminate this Agreement for convenience by giving at least thirty (30) days written notice of termination to Detto. This Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach of this Agreement by the other party that is not cured within thirty (30) days of the other party's receipt of written notice of such breach. If a material breach is cured within a thirty (30) day cure period this Agreement shall remain in effect as if no material breach had occurred. This Agreement shall terminate automatically without notice and without further action by the other party in the event that the other party becomes insolvent, which means it becomes unable to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as they come due, or makes an assignment of this Agreement for the benefit of creditors.\n\n5.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement:\n\n(a) Detto shall, within thirty (30) days, pay to PivX all amounts due hereunder, return to PivX all products and demonstration copies received from PivX, erase any and all of the foregoing from all computer memories and storage devices within Detto's possession or control and, if requested, provide PivX with a signed written statement that Detto has complied with the foregoing obligations. All rights and licenses granted by PivX hereunder shall terminate, provided such termination shall not result in the termination of Licenses for copies of Qwik-Fix Pro which already have been purchased by Third Parties in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n(b) The following shall survive termination of this Agreement: Section 1.2, the last two sentences of Section 2.2, Sections 2.3 through and including 2.9, Section 3.6, Section 4, this Section 5 and Section 6. 5.4 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY UPON TERMINATION. In the event of termination in accordance with Section 5.1, PivX shall not be liable to Detto because of such termination for compensation, reimbursement or damages on account of the loss of prospective profits or anticipated sales or on account of expenditures, inventory, investments, leases or commitments in connection with the business or goodwill of Detto.\n\n6. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n6.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. By virtue of this Agreement, each party may have access to information that is confidential to the other (\"Confidential Information\"). Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to, software, documentation, formulas, methods, know how, processes, designs, new products, developmental work, marketing requirements, marketing plans, customer names, prospective customer names, the terms and pricing under the Agreement, and any information clearly identified in writing at the time of disclosure as confidential. A party's Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; or (b) is independently developed by the other party without\n\n                                       5\n\nuse of or reference to the first party's Confidential Information. In the event, Confidential Information is required to be disclosed by law or other governmental authority, a party hereunder shall not be prohibited from disclosing such information by this Section provided that the responding party shall first have given prompt notice to the other party hereto and shall have made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order restricting or limiting the disclosure of the Confidential Information to the extent possible.\n\n6.2 THIS AGREEMENT CONTROLS; MERGER; AMENDMENT; WAIVER. This Agreement and Exhibit A to this Agreement shall control Detto's distribution of Qwik-Fix Pro and Documentation. All different or additional terms or conditions in any Detto purchase order or similar document shall be null and void. This Agreement, including Exhibit A, constitutes the final, complete, and exclusive agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements. No modification, amendment, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing signed by both parties. The failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any such right, power or remedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 NOTICES. All notices shall be given in writing and shall be considered effective when (a) personally delivered, (b) upon confirmed receipt if sent by electronic mail or facsimile; or (c) two (2) days after posting if sent by overnight registered private carrier (e.g. DHL, Federal Express, etc.).\n\n6.4 ASSIGNMENT. Detto may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without PivX's prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n6.5 FORCE MAJEURE. PivX will not incur any liability to Detto or any other party on account of any loss or damage resulting from any delay or failure to perform all or any part of this Agreement (except for payment obligations) to the extent such delay or failure is caused, in whole or in part, by events, occurrences, or causes beyond the control, and without the negligence of, the parties. Such events, occurrences, or causes include, without limitation, acts of God, telecommunications outages, Internet outages, power outages, strikes, lockouts, riots, acts of war, floods, earthquakes, fires, and explosions.\n\n6.6 GENERAL. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Detto is an independent contractor, and nothing herein shall be construed to create an employer-employee, partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship between the parties. Detto shall have no authority, right or power to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of PivX.\n\n6.7 GOVERNING LAW.

MediWound shall be responsible for ordering, at its expense, sufficient quantities of labeling as forecasted to be required, based upon the [***] of the then-current Rolling Forecast. MediWound shall store the labeling as required by Regulatory Standards and shall use the labeling in Product packaging as set forth in the Specifications. Vericel shall be permitted to require changes to the labeling artwork from time-to-time at its cost, but will be required to reimburse MediWound for the cost of any quantities of labeling procured by MediWound that is rendered unusable by such changes, up to the quantities of labeling as\n\n6 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nforecasted to be required, based upon the [***] of the then-current Rolling Forecast as of the date of such change by Vericel of the labeling artwork. [***].\n\n2.5 Subcontracting.\n\n(a) [***]. No Third Party service provider or subcontractor shall be provided with Vericel's Confidential Information without first executing a confidentiality agreement that contains terms and conditions that are at least as protective as the confidentiality terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain liable for the performance of all Third Party subcontractors and its Affiliates under this Agreement.\n\n(b) MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any Third Party Supply Agreement [***].\n\n(c) If the forecasting or order timing or other provisions of a Third Party Supply Agreement do not align with the corresponding provisions of this Agreement then the Parties shall discuss in good faith appropriate modifications to this Agreement or to such Third Party Supply Agreement, to bring the relevant provisions into alignment; provided, however, that Vericel or MediWound shall have no obligation to agree to any amendment to this Agreement or such Third Party Supply Agreement that can reasonably be expected to materially disadvantage Vericel or MediWound, respectively.\n\n2.6 Facilities.\n\n(a) Current and Expanded Capacity. The Parties agree and acknowledge that, as of the Effective Date, MediWound's current Facility can fill orders from Vericel for use in the Territory up to [***] of Intermediate Drug Product, whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product within a calendar year (\"Maximum Capacity\"). The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Facility will require either expansion or modification (which may include moving to or adding another location) to meet future capacity requirements for the Product. By no later than [***], MediWound shall fund, at its sole cost, the expansion of its annual manufacturing capacity to be [***] of Intermediate Drug Product (whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product). The Parties will in good faith review existing market research to mutually agree on peak anticipated volume prior to [***]. After the foregoing expansion, the expanded capacity shall be deemed the \"Maximum Capacity\" for purposes of this Agreement. As part of the expansion of the Facility, the Parties will discuss any shut down or transfer to another facility made in connection therewith.\n\n(b) Shut-Down or Expansion of Facility; Transfer to Another Facility. In the event that MediWound desires to cease or shut down operations at a Facility, expand or modify a Facility, or transfer the Manufacturing of a Product to another facility which would reasonably be anticipated to result in inability (permanent or temporary) of MediWound to Manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder, MediWound shall provide prior written notice to Vericel within the applicable Change Notification Period of such planned shut-down, cessation, expansion, modification or transfer. During such Change Notification Period, Vericel\n\n7 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nwill have the right to order, and in such case MediWound will manufacture, up to [***] of quantities of Product set forth in the Rolling Forecast with respect to such Change Notification Period which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MediWound shall remain obligated to supply Product at the then current Facility and will not supply Product to Vericel from a new facility unless and until MediWound can perform the Manufacturing and supply Product from such new Facility in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any modifications to the regulatory filings for such Product are approved by the relevant Regulatory Authorities. MediWound shall bear all costs incurred in connection with the shut-down, cessation, expansion or modification of the Facility or transfer of the Manufacturing of a Product to a new facility pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), including any costs associated with changes to the regulatory filings. Once such new facility is able to Manufacture in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all required regulatory changes have been approved, such new facility shall be the Facility for purposes of such Product under this Agreement.\n\n2.7 Establishment of Second Source.\n\n(a) Within [***] of the Effective Date, MediWound must provide Vericel with true and accurate copies of all documents consistent with Schedule 2.7. If MediWound does not provide all documents within [***] of the Effective Date, Vericel's obligation under Section 8.1 regarding the time period to provide MediWound with a notice of an extension of the Initial Term shall be extended by the amount of time beyond [***] taken by MediWound to provide the required documents.\n\n(b) Within [***] of a request by Vericel to initiate technology transfer or as soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Vericel in connection with a Supply Failure, MediWound shall provide Vericel, at Vericel's cost consistent with Schedule 4.5, with information necessary for Vericel to qualify a second or back-up supplier identified by Vericel for the Manufacture and supply of Product (a \"Second Source\") and facilitate technology transfer to such Second Source so that Vericel can consistently manufacture intermediate and final product that meets all specifications. MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications. Second Source manufacturers shall be permitted to manufacture Product for Vericel, its Affiliates and Sublicensees as provided in Section 9.1 and the License Agreement; provided that such Second Source manufacturers: [***].\n\n2.8 Forecasting and Ordering.\n\n(a) Forecasting. Vericel shall furnish MediWound with a [***] rolling forecast of the quantities of each Product that Vericel intends to order during the succeeding [***] period (each, a \"Rolling Forecast\") which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity for the Binding Forecast. No later than [***] after the filing of a BLA, Vericel shall\n\n8 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nfurnish MediWound the first rolling Forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding order for the quantities of Product specified (\"Binding Forecast\"). The remaining [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall be non-binding, but shall represent Vericel's good faith estimate, as of the date of its submission of the Rolling Forecast, of its forecasted requirements of the Product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity.\n\n(b) Purchase Orders. On a Calendar Quarter basis, Vericel shall issue at least one Purchase Order for the number and unit size of each Product specified in the Binding Forecast. Vericel is not limited to one Purchase Order per Calendar Quarter. Each Purchase Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i) accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If MediWound timely notifies Vericel that a Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement, the Parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues related to such purported nonconformity. If MediWound fails to respond to a Purchase Order that is consistent with the Binding Forecast within [***] after receiving it, Vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with MediWound that such Purchase Order was received by MediWound, and if such Purchase Order is consistent with the Binding Forecast and was properly submitted by Vericel in accordance with this Section 2.8(b), MediWound shall be deemed to have accepted such Purchase Order (\"Binding Order\") as of the date of MediWound's receipt of such Purchase Order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast (\"Excess Amount\"), MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Should Vericel place a Purchase Order to procure a given Product in a given Calendar Quarter which includes an Excess Amount, MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet Vericel's request. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern.\n\n(c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel's submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year).\n\n(d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the\n\n9 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n\"BARDA Agreements\") with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (\"BARDA\"). The Parties agree that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During such period, any Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will not be included in Purchase Orders, Binding Orders, Rolling Forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, then Vericel shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by BARDA in its Purchase Orders, Binding Orders and Rolling Forecasts and such purchases will be included in the Maximum Capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c).\n\n2.9 Delivery.\n\n(a) Shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms 2010), at MediWound's facility (the \"Delivery Site\") at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products.\n\n(b) Delivery Amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable shortage quantities.\n\n(c) On Time Delivery. MediWound's performance with respect to \"on time delivery\" will be measured as delivery to Vericel [***] before or after the delivery date agreed\n\n10 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nbetween Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8; provided that MediWound shall be deemed to have made a delivery during the \"on time delivery\" window if the delay in delivery to Vericel is due to Vericel's failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement (including in connection with Vericel's review of the Batch records).\n\n2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the \"Minimum Shelf Life\").\n\n2.11 Safety Stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the \"Safety Stock\") so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk.\n\n2.12 Non-Conforming Product.\n\n(a) Rejection Notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection (\"Rejection Notice\") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product (\"Non-Conforming Product\") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such Rejection Notice provided with respect to any quantity of Product shall be deemed to apply to the full Batch of such Product unless otherwise specified by Vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product.\n\n(b) Disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel's claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error.\n\n11 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel's Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall, [***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound's gross negligence or willful misconduct):\n\n(i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel;\n\n(ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or\n\n(iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound's instruction. This subsection (iii) shall additionally apply in the event Vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii), as applicable, and such delivery or replace of Product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by MediWound).\n\n2.13 Shortages.\n\n(a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all Binding Orders for Product.\n\n(b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than Vericel.\n\n(c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound's supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently situated customers or MediWound's own similarly situated products.\n\n12 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules.\n\n2.14 Supply Failures. In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply Failure, then MediWound shall promptly (and in no event later than [***] from the date of such awareness) notify Vericel of the particular circumstances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure. MediWound shall investigate the root cause of the anticipated Supply Failure and prepare and provide to Vericel a Remediation Plan within [***] of MediWound's notice to Vericel. If the Remediation Plan is acceptable to Vericel, and MediWound is able to reasonably assure Vericel of MediWound's ability to Manufacture Product and, thereby, (a) avoid a Supply Failure or (b) supply Product in accordance with the Rolling Forecast within [***], then MediWound shall continue to Manufacture Product for Vericel. In all other cases, Vericel shall be permitted to take such measures as are reasonably determined in good faith by Vericel to ensure the supply of Product to the marketplace including cancelling or revising outstanding Purchase Orders and, at Vericel's option, Vericel's obligations under Section 2.8(a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed terminated.\n\nARTICLE 3  COMPLIANCE, QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL\n\n3.1 Certificates of Analysis; Release. MediWound shall perform, or cause to be performed testing and other activities on each Batch of Product Manufactured pursuant to this Agreement before delivery to Vericel or Vericel's designated Affiliate or contractor and consistent with the testing and procedures specified in the Quality Agreement. In the event of any change in Specifications, the certificate of analysis shall contain the required information in accordance with the then-approved release tests in conjunction with applicable change control procedures in accordance with this Agreement and the Quality Agreement. MediWound shall send, or cause to be sent, such certificates to Vericel prior to delivery of each such Batch unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing or specified in the Quality Agreement.\n\n3.2 Records. MediWound shall maintain and shall cause each Supplier to maintain all Manufacturing records, including packaging, analytical and stability records, all records of shipment, and all validation data relating to the Product Manufactured and supplied to Vericel hereunder for the Territory to the extent and for the time periods required by applicable Regulatory Standards with respect to such Product.

In the event MediWound is unable to supply Product as a result of such Regulatory Change, Vericel, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to source all or any portion of Vericel's requirements of the applicable Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party, including from the Second Source. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if as a result of a Regulatory Change, MediWound is unable to Manufacture and supply a Product to Vericel, Vericel shall be entitled to source such Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party or Second Source in accordance with this Section 4.4(b), in which case MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Vericel with reasonable technical assistance with regard to transferring the technology relating to the Product to such Third Party, and the Parties shall discuss the allocation of such costs related to such transfer, including MediWound's expenses and any incremental costs of supply of such Product and Materials from such Third Party consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n(c) If MediWound determines it is technically able to implement a Regulatory Change required by a Regulatory Authority in the Territory, the costs for such Regulatory Change shall be borne by Vericel consistent with Schedule 4.5.\n\n17 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Ongoing Regulatory Assistance. Within [***] following Vericel's request, MediWound shall provide technical data and assistance in answering Vericel's questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by MediWound at no cost to Vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by Vericel at the cost of Vericel for the applicable number of hours at a Full Time Equivalent rate described in Schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at Vericel's cost, and (d) for periodic regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of Vericel.\n\nARTICLE 5  PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS\n\n5.1 Supply Price. On a Product-by-Product basis, the price payable in U.S. Dollars by Vericel for supply of such Product for a given Calendar Year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on Exhibit A (with respect to each Product, the \"Supply Price\"), which shall be updated on a Calendar Year basis in accordance with Section 5.2 below.\n\n5.2 Price Mechanics.\n\n(a) Beginning on [***] (each, a \"Re-Pricing Date\"), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the \"PPI\") [***] and (b) in the event the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price.\n\n(b) In addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism, MediWound may propose an adjustment to the Supply Price to reflect changes that substantially affect MediWound's costs or ability to supply Product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price adjustment is required. Following Vericel's receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any.\n\n(c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase Order placed after Vericel's receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism.\n\n5.3 Cost Savings. Either Party may propose changes to any Manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings in such process (\"Cost Savings Change\"). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility, and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee,\n\n18 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change; and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e. [***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price).\n\n5.4 Payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***] from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The Parties' respective rights and responsibilities under Sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the License Agreement shall apply as such Section pertains to the Parties' performance under this Agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this Agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this Agreement and, in the event such date is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment, subject to the terms of this Agreement.\n\n5.6 Taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable Laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, MediWound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide MediWound with reasonable assistance to enable MediWound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable Laws or regulations.\n\n19 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 6 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS\n\n6.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties.

In the event either Party learns that it, any of its employees or contractors, any Supplier or any of a Supplier's employees or contractors has been debarred, it shall notify the other Party promptly, and in any event within [***] of learning of such debarment. In the event that MediWound, any of its employees or contractors, any Supplier or any of a Supplier's employees or contractors has been debarred, MediWound shall immediately remove or have removed such Person from thereafter performing Manufacturing or supply activities under this Agreement with respect to the Product upon learning of such debarment. In the event that Vericel, any of its employees or contractors, any Sublicensee or any of such Sublicensee's employees or contractors has been debarred, it shall immediately remove or have removed such Person from thereafter performing distribution activities under this Agreement with respect to the Product upon learning of such debarment.\n\nARTICLE 7  INDEMNITY, INSURANCE\n\n7.1 Indemnification by MediWound. MediWound will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Vericel, its Affiliates, Sublicensees, contractors, Distributors and each of its and their respective employees, officers, directors and agents (each, a \"Vericel Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all liability, loss, damage, expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) and cost (collectively, \"Liability\") that the Vericel Indemnified Party may be required to pay to one or more Third Parties resulting from or arising out of:\n\n(a) the material breach by MediWound of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in Article 6;\n\n(b) any Recall or withdrawal of Product to the extent attributable to MediWound's breach of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement; or\n\n(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of MediWound or any subcontractor or Supplier acting on behalf of MediWound relating to its activities in connection with this Agreement; except, in each case, to the extent (y) caused by the negligence, recklessness or intentional acts of Vericel or any Vericel Indemnified Party or (z) Vericel is required to indemnify MediWound pursuant to Section 7.2.\n\n7.2 Indemnification by Vericel. Vericel will indemnify, defend and hold harmless MediWound, each of its Affiliates, and each of its and its Affiliates' employees, officers, directors and agents (each, a \"MediWound Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all Liability that the MediWound Indemnified Party may be required to pay to one or more Third Parties (other than shareholders of MediWound or its Affiliates) resulting from or arising out of:\n\n(a) the material breach by Vericel of any of its representations, warranties or covenants set forth in Article 6;\n\n21 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) any Recall or withdrawal of Product to the extent attributable to Vericel's breach of this Agreement or the Quality Agreement; or\n\n(c) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Vericel or any subcontractor or Supplier acting on behalf of Vericel relating to its activities in connection with this Agreement; except, in each case, to the extent (y) caused by the negligence, recklessness or intentional acts of MediWound or any MediWound Indemnified Party or (z) MediWound is required to indemnify Vericel pursuant to Section 7.1.\n\n7.3 No Right of Indemnification under License Agreement. No right of indemnification shall exist under the License Agreement for claims arising out of the performance of this Agreement, it being the intent of the Parties that such claims shall be solely governed by the provisions of this Agreement and, for the avoidance of doubt, except as set forth in Section 7.6, no limits on indemnification or liability set forth in the License Agreement shall apply to this Agreement.\n\n7.4 Procedure.\n\n(a) Notice. Each Party will notify the other Party in writing in the event it becomes aware of a claim for which indemnification may be sought hereunder. In the event that any Third Party asserts a claim or other proceeding (including any governmental investigation) with respect to any matter for which a Party (the \"Indemnified Party\") is entitled to indemnification hereunder (a \"Third Party Claim\"), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Party obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") thereof; provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless (and then only to the extent that) the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby.\n\n(b) Control. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement of or assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume direction and control of the defense, litigation, settlement, appeal or other disposition of the Third Party Claim (including the right to settle the claim solely for monetary consideration) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party has sufficient financial resources, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, to satisfy the amount of any adverse monetary judgment that is sought, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks solely monetary damages and (iii) the Indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full (the conditions set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above are collectively referred to as the \"Litigation Conditions\"). Within [***] after the Indemnifying Party has given notice to the Indemnified Party of its exercise of its right to defend a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give notice to the Indemnifying Party of any objection thereto based upon the Litigation Conditions. If the Indemnified Party reasonably so objects, the Indemnified Party shall continue to defend the Third Party Claim, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, until such time as\n\n22 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch objection is withdrawn. If no such notice is given, or if any such objection is withdrawn, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole cost and expense, to assume direction and control of such defense, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. During such time as the Indemnifying Party is controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate, and shall cause its Affiliates and agents to cooperate upon request of the Indemnifying Party, in the defense or prosecution of the Third Party Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and testimony and attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals as may reasonably be requested by the Indemnifying Party. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Conditions or does not notify the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's intent to defend any Third Party Claim within [***] after notice thereof, the Indemnified Party may (without further notice to the Indemnifying Party) undertake the defense thereof with counsel of its choice and at the Indemnifying Party's expense (including reasonable, out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and costs and expenses of enforcement or defense). The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall have the right to join in (including the right to conduct discovery, interview and examine witnesses and participate in all settlement conferences), but not control, at its own expense, the defense of any Third Party Claim that the other party is defending as provided in this Agreement.\n\n(c) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any compromise or settlement that commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to take, any action. The Indemnified Party shall have the sole and exclusive right to settle any Third Party Claim, on such terms and conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief, but shall not have the right to settle such Third Party Claim to the extent such Third Party Claim involves monetary damages without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. Each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission of liability in respect of any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the other party, and the Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate liabilities arising from such Third Party Claim.\n\n7.5 Disclaimer. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY MAKES, AND EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF PRODUCT HEREUNDER), EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n7.6 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY OR OTHERWISE, SUFFERED BY THE OTHER PARTY, EVEN IF THAT PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. [***].\n\n23 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7 Insurance. For the duration of this Agreement and for a period of [***] following its termination, each Party agrees to obtain and maintain, during the Term, commercial general liability insurance, including product liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers (or pursuant to a program of self-insurance reasonably satisfactory to the other Party) to cover its indemnification obligations under Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as applicable, in each case with limits of not less than [***] per occurrence and in the aggregate. Insurance shall be procured with carriers having an A.M. Best Rating of A-VII or better.\n\nARTICLE 8  TERM AND TERMINATION\n\n8.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and will continue until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Effective Date, unless earlier terminated or extended under this Article 8 (the \"Initial Term\"). At least twenty-four (24) months from the end of the Initial Term, Vericel shall provide MediWound notice whether Vericel elects to extend the Initial Term of the Agreement by an additional twenty four (24) months. After the Initial Term (including any extension thereto made in accordance with the preceding sentence), the Agreement may be extended on a yearly basis up to ten (10) years at Vericel's sole discretion, with renewal notice to be provided to MediWound no later than twelve (12) months prior to the expiry of any yearly extension (the \"Renewal Term\", and the Initial Term, together with the Renewal Term, if any, the \"Term\"); provided that unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Term of this Agreement (including the Initial Term, any extension of the Initial Term and any Renewal Terms) shall be no more than fifteen (15) years in total.\n\n8.2 Automatic Termination. This Agreement will automatically immediately terminate in the event of the expiration or termination of the License Agreement.\n\n8.3 Termination for Breach. Subject to the provisions of Article 10 below, either Party may terminate this Agreement in its entirety if the other Party materially breaches a material provision and does not cure such breach, or does not take reasonable steps required under the circumstances to cure such breach going forward, within [***] after receiving notice of the breach.\n\n8.4 Termination by Vericel. Following the Initial Term, Vericel may, without penalty or prejudice to any other rights or remedies Vericel may have, in its sole discretion terminate or reduce the scope of any individual activities contemplated by this Agreement or any Additional Service or with respect to any Product or terminate this Agreement as a whole with or without cause, upon [***] prior written notice of such termination or reduction (which such written notice may be provided during the Initial Term).\n\n8.5 Termination by MediWound. Following the Initial Term, MediWound may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Vericel upon on at least [***] advanced written notice (or such longer period of time as reasonably necessary to avoid a supply disruption) if MediWound determines to cease Manufacturing the applicable Product for the Territory, but in such case MediWound will reasonably cooperate with Vericel to enable Vericel to establish its own source for the Product (including, to the extent requested by Vericel and within\n\n24 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nMediWound's ability to do so, by transferring MediWound's applicable Third Party manufacturing relationships to Vericel).\n\n8.6 Effects of Termination. Any expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any claims that have accrued or outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to such termination or expiration, nor shall it prejudice any other remedies that the Parties may have under this Agreement. In addition, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement:\n\n(a) if Vericel terminates the Agreement for breach or MediWound terminates in accordance with Section 8.5, Vericel shall have the option of [***]\n\n(b) Vericel shall pay to MediWound: (i) all amounts outstanding and remaining to be paid for Product supplied prior to such expiration or termination or under any other obligation under the Agreement; (ii) all amounts for Product in the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders prior to the expiration or termination, provided that MediWound delivers such Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) all amounts representing the purchase by MediWound of Materials in reliance upon the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders (if MediWound is unable to cancel (without incurring any costs) or otherwise use such Materials); and (iv) all amounts representing remaining inventory of Product and all Product work in process undertaken in accordance with the Binding Forecasts or Binding Orders or undertaken otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n(c) Following expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the License Agreement) for any Licensed Product in a given country, the license granted to Vericel under Section 9.1 of this Agreement with respect to such Licensed Product in such country shall automatically become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.\n\n8.7 Survival. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the following terms of this Agreement shall survive: Article 1, Sections 3.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, Article 7, Article 8, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (except in the event of termination of the License Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 thereof), Section 9.3, Article 10, and Article 11.\n\nARTICLE 9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n9.1 Manufacturing License Grant. Subject to the terms herein, MediWound hereby grants to Vericel a non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound's interest in the Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory.\n\n9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty- free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non- exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in\n\n25 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\neach case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the Licensed Trademarks by Vericel (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and Distributors) in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory shall be in accordance with Regulatory Approvals and all applicable Laws and MediWound's quality control guidelines for the Licensed Trademarks, as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the marketing of, any other products.\n\n9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the Parties in the course of Manufacturing and supply of the Product hereunder (including Manufacture and supply of Product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement.\n\nARTICLE 10  FORCE MAJEURE\n\n10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or acts of God (a \"Force Majeure Event\"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event will not excuse or prevent a failure of MediWound to deliver Product from being deemed a \"Supply Failure\" or otherwise limit Vericel's rights, to the extent applicable, under Section 2.13.\n\n10.2 Notice of Force Majeure Event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected.\n\n10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with diligent risk management practices, MediWound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound's products (including EscharEx).\n\n26 9012190/26\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICLE 11  MISCELLANEOUS\n\n11.1 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder shall be assignable by a Party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except as follows: (a) such Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that the assignee shall expressly agree to be bound by such Party's obligations under this Agreement and that such Party shall remain liable for all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, and (b) either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a Third Party in connection with a permitted assignment or other permitted transfer of the License Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of this Section 11.1. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the name of a Party appearing herein shall be deemed to include the names of such Party's successors and permitted assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this Agreement. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 11.1 shall be void.\n\n11.2 Further Actions. Each Party agrees to execute, acknowledge and deliver such further instruments, and to do all such other acts, as may be necessary or appropriate in order to carry out the purposes and intent of the Agreement.\n\n11.3 Notices.

No amendment, modification or supplement of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of each Party.\n\n11.5 Waiver. No provision of this Agreement shall be waived by any act, omission or knowledge of a Party or its agents or employees except by an instrument in writing expressly waiving such provision and signed by a duly authorized officer of the waiving Party. The waiver by either of the Parties of any breach of any provision hereof by the other Party shall not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach of such provision or a waiver of the provision itself.\n\n11.6 Severability. If any clause or portion thereof in this Agreement is for any reason held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the same shall not affect any other portion of this Agreement, as it is the intent of the Parties that this Agreement shall be construed in such fashion as to maintain its existence, validity and enforceability to the greatest extent possible.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n    8.1.  Negotiation and Escalation.  If any controversy or claim arises relating to this Agreement, the Parties will attempt in good faith to negotiate a solution to their differences, including progressively escalating any controversy or claim through senior levels of management.

Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim between the Parties concerning any breach or alleged breach of this Agreement or performance or nonperformance of any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise with respect to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by negotiation will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] and the then-current Commercial Rules and supervision of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"). If any part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration] is held to be unenforceable, it will be severed and will not affect either the duty to arbitrate or any other part of this Section 8.2  [Arbitration].  The arbitration will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, before a sole disinterested arbitrator who is knowledgeable in business information and the Internet and experienced in handling commercial disputes.  The arbitrator shall be appointed jointly by the Parties hereto within 30 days following the date on which the arbitration is instituted.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator within such 30-day period, the AAA shall be instructed to select such arbitrator within 15 days thereafter.  The arbitrator's award will be final and binding and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, or any damages excluded by, or in excess of, any damage limitations expressed in this Agreement.  Issues of arbitrability will be determined in accordance solely with the federal substantive and procedural laws relating to arbitration; in all other respects, the arbitrator will be obligated to apply and follow the substantive law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n    8.3.  Equitable Relief.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 9 of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary and permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator.  The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing.\n\n    8.4.  Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party.  To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred.\n\n    8.5.  Two Year Limitation.  Except for claims under Sections 11.4  [Indemnification by LeadersOnline] and 11.5  [Indemnification by VerticalNet] hereof, neither Party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to\n\n                                       9\n\nthis Agreement, including any claim of fraud or misrepresentation, more than two years after the cause of action accrues or becomes known, whichever is later.\n\n    8.6.  Confidentiality.  In order to facilitate the resolution of controversies or claims between the Parties with respect to each Party hereto, such controversies or claims, including details regarding negotiations, arbitration and settlement terms, shall be treated as Confidential Information of the other Party hereto in accordance with Article 9.\n\n    8.7.  Remedial Measures. In the event of (a) any material remediable breach of this Agreement by the other Party which remains uncured 30 days after notice of such breach (other than a breach of a payment obligation) was received by the other Party or (b) any material breach which cannot be cured, the non-breaching Party may take reasonable remediable measures upon prior written notice and at the cost and expense of the breaching Party without prejudice and in addition to any other rights arising from such breach.  In addition, the non-breaching Party shall take reasonable steps to mitigate damages arising out of such breach.\n\nSource: LEADERSONLINE INC, S-1/A, 4/27/2000\n\n\n\n\n\n9.

Termination.  Subject to Section 12.12  [Survival], upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information shall be returned to the disclosing Party or, at the request of the disclosing Party, destroyed unless otherwise specified or permitted elsewhere under this Agreement.  The confidentiality obligations contained in this Article 9 shall survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.\n\n                                       10\n\n    9.4.  Injunction.  Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of this Article 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the other Party's interests in its Confidential Information, that any breach of the provisions of this Article 9 may result in irreparable harm to such other Party, and that the remedy at law for such breach may be inadequate.  Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article 9 by a Party hereto, the other Party, in addition to any other relief available to it at law, in equity or otherwise, shall be entitled to seek temporary and permanent injunctive relief restraining the breaching Party from engaging in and/or continuing any conduct that would constitute a breach of this Article 9, without posting a bond or other security.\n\n    9.5.  Publicity. Except as may be required by law in which case a party will provide as much advance notice as reasonably possible, neither Party will originate any press release concerning the relationship between the Parties or the transactions described in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, VerticalNet and LeadersOnline shall jointly issue a press release with respect to entering into this Agreement.\n\n    9.6.

LeadersOnline shall provide VerticalNet with User Data on each User that enters the LeadersOnline Site through a Link from a VerticalNet Site and submits information through the LeadersOnline Site by sending an email with such information to an email address designated by VerticalNet at the time the request occurs.

The Distributor shall initiate purchases under this Agreement by submitting written purchase orders (each, an \"Order\") to JRVS. Such orders shall state unit quantities, unit descriptions, requested delivery dates, and shipping instructions. No purchase order shall be binding upon JRVS until accepted by JRVS in writing.

No terms on purchase orders, invoices or like documents produced by the Distributor shall alter or add to the terms of this Agreement. Any other terms and conditions of sale in conflict with or inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, whether contained in the Distributor's preprinted forms or otherwise, notwithstanding JRVS's acceptance otherwise, shall have no force or effect to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency. 4.3 Order Requirements.

Except as provided herein, all Orders for Products are non-cancelable, and Products are non-returnable (NC/NR).

The Nonstandard Products are at all times non-cancelable. Distributor shall contact JRVS in advance for pricing and delivery information for orders of Non-standard Products. 5.1 JRVS Price.

The meet comp quote number shall be included on all such debits. 5.4 Taxes. All JRVS Prices are exclusive of any export, withholding, federal, state and local taxes, duties or excises other than taxes based on JRVS's net income. If JRVS pays any taxes, duties or excises which are not included in the fees charged for the Product, JRVS shall itemize such taxes, duties or excises as a separate item on its invoices to the Distributor, and the Distributor shall reimburse JRVS for such taxes, duties or excises; provided, that the Distributor shall not be required to make any such reimbursement if it provides a valid tax exemption certificate to JRVS prior to shipment. 3\n\nSource: IMINE CORP, S-1, 7/25/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

Accordingly, the Services under this Agreement are zero-rated                for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax (hereinafter                 referred to as \"GST\") pursuant to Section 1 of Part VII of                Schedule VI of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, Chapter E-15,                as amended from time to time.\n\n    (b)     In the event that \"GST\" or any other value added or sales taxes                are applicable at any time during the Term of this Agreement:\n\n                 (i)    Either party shall be liable for the same, if                             applicable;\n\n                 (ii)   Either Party shall identify such tax separately on                             each invoice; and\n\n                 (iii)  Either Party's GST registration number shall                             appear on each invoice.\n\n6.0    LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE\n\n6.1    A Party shall be liable to the other for loss, damage or delay to        Freight due to its acts or omissions, including its negligence, and        those of its employees, agents and those for whom in law it is        responsible and occurring while Freight is in its care, custody or        control. For the purpose of this Agreement, Freight shall be considered        in the care, custody or control of a Party from the time it is tendered        to it by the other Party or the other Party's customer until the time of        its delivery to the other Party or the consignee, as intended. For        greater certainty, a Party shall not be liable hereunder if the Freight        is damaged solely as a result of improper packing.\n\n6.2    A Party shall, in the event of loss, damage or delay to Freight while in        its care, custody or control, immediately notify the other Party of the         loss or damage, carry out an investigation of the incident to determine        the cause of such loss, damage or delay and shall within\n\n7        thirty (30) days of the event of loss, damage or delay or knowledge of        such incident of loss, damage or delay, whichever is later, as the case        may be, report its findings to the other Party. All costs associated        with such investigation shall be the responsibility of such Party if the        loss, damage or delay was due to the acts or omissions or those of its        employees, agents or those for whom in law its is responsible;        otherwise, the costs shall be shared equally by the Parties hereto.\n\n6.3    A party shall, for any loss, damage or delay to Freight while in its        care, custody or control, forthwith pay to the other Party the actual        damages suffered by such other Party. Such liability shall not exceed the        other Party's contractual liability to its customers. The Parties        acknowledge that their contract of carriage with their customers provides        that liability for loss, damage or delay, including liability for        consequential loss, is limited to Four Dollars and Forty One Cents        ($4.41) per kilogram or Two Dollars ($2.00) per pound unless a higher        value has been declared for insurance purposes.\n\n7.0    SET-OFF\n\n7.1    A Party shall pay to the other the full amount of any paid claim, loss        or damage for which it is liable within forty five (45) days following           presentation of supporting documentation. If a Party fails to pay        following presentation of supporting documentation then the other Party        shall have the right to deduct the amount of such claim, loss or damage        from any monies due or becoming due to the first Party by the second        Party.\n\n8.0    INDEMNIFICATION\n\n8.1    Each Party shall at all times indemnify and hold harmless the other, its        directors, officers, employees and any others for whom it may be        responsible in law, from and against all claims, including claims made        by the indemnifying Party's personnel under worker's compensation        legislation, demands, awards, judgments, actions and proceedings by        whomsoever made, brought or prosecuted in respect of loss of, damage to        or destruction of property (including loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying party) or personal injury including death and from and        against any and all loss or, damage to or destruction of property,        expenses and costs (including legal fees and disbursements) suffered or        incurred by the indemnifying Party, its directors, officers, employees\n\n\n\n\n\n    and any others for whom it may be responsible in law, arising out of or        in any way connected with the indemnifying Party, its directors,        officers, employees and any others for whom it may be responsible in law,        arising out of or in any way connected with the indemnifying Party        provision of Services under this Agreement and whether or not caused by        the indemnifying Party's negligence. Loss or damage sustained by the        indemnifying Party shall also include loss as a result of loss of use.\n\n8                                      - 8 -\n\n8.2    Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the        indemnifying party's liability to the other hereunder shall not        exceed the insurance coverage set out in Section 9.0.\n\n9.0    INSURANCE\n\n9.1    Each Party shall purchase and maintain, at its own expense, the        following insurance coverages:\n\n    (a)     cargo liability insurance, subject to a combined single limit of                not less than One Hundred Thousand dollars ($100,000.00)                inclusive per occurrence. The other Party shall be named as an                additional insured and the policy shall contain a cross                liability clause;\n\n    (b)     automobile, non-owned automobile, fleet, comprehensive general,                public and property liability insurance with a limit of not less                than Two Million dollars ($2,000,000.00) inclusive of bodily                injury and property damage for any one occurrence arising out of                one (1) cause. The policy shall cover all non-air operations,                non-owned automobile, contractual liability and liability                specifically assumed under this Agreement.

It shall        be the sole responsibility of each Party to determine what additional        insurance coverages, if any, are necessary and advisable for its own        protection\n\n9                                      - 9 -\n\n    or to fulfil its obligations under this Agreement. Any such additional        insurance shall be provided and maintained by that Party at its own        expense.\n\n9.6    Each Party shall ensure that any subcontractor or other party with whom        it contracts in providing the Services shall carry adequate        insurance coverage, but not less than that provided in paragraph 9.1.\n\n10.1   COMPLIANCE WITH LAW\n\n10.1   (a)     Each Party shall comply with all legislation directly or                indirectly applicable to the performance of its obligations                under this Agreement.\n\n    (b)     Each Party shall notify the other at least thirty (30) days or                in any event as soon as possible, before any change is made in                its licences or operating authorities which may affect in any                way the performance of any of its obligations under this                Agreement.\n\n11.0   PROTECTION OF FREIGHT\n\n11.1   Each Party shall take all reasonable measures to ensure that Freight in        its care, custody or control is protected at all times from theft,        weather and all other damage or danger, and without restricting the        foregoing, shall ensure that:\n\n    (a)     Freight is not kept out-of-doors except for purposes of loading                or off loading; and\n\n    (b)     If at any time Freight is not under its complete visual and                physical control, it shall provide a secure storage area\n\n\n\n\n\n            in a facility at its own cost.\n\n12.0   SECURITY\n\n12.1   Each Party shall ensure that all reasonable security and investigation        measures are implemented including but not limited to the provisions set        forth in Schedule \"F\" respecting the provision of Services.\n\n12.2   Each Party shall implement and put in place security and investigation           procedures to ensure the protection and security of Freight. These        procedures shall include spot checks, inspections, reporting,        investigations and any other procedures to ensure not only that the        Services required by the other Party are provided but that the Services        are provided in accordance with industry standards.\n\n10                                      - 10 -\n\n13.0   DANGEROUS GOODS\n\n13.1   The Parties acknowledge that the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act,        S.C. 1992, c.34, as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred        to as the \"TDGA\") prohibits transportation of any explosive, dangerous         or destructive substance, or anything likely to injure or damage property        or persons (hereinafter referred to as \"Dangerous Goods\") unless the        requirements of the TDGA are met. The Parties agree that they only intend        for Dangerous Goods to be carried pursuant to this Agreement if the        requirements of the TDGA are met and both Parties are aware that such        goods are being carried. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties agree        that neither Dynamex nor Purolator shall be under any obligation or duty        whatsoever to open for prior inspection any Freight tendered to Dynamex        pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Party shall be responsible for any        losses or damage whatsoever that may be sustained by the other Party, its        directors, officers, employees and any persons for whom it may become        responsible in law, as a result of any Dangerous Goods contained in        Freight unless such Party had actual prior knowledge of the presence of        Dangerous Goods. In the event a Party had actual prior knowledge of the        presence of Dangerous Goods, then it shall be liable for loss or damage        to the other Party if it would otherwise be liable under this Agreement        or at law.\n\n13.2   Each Party must comply with the placarding and all other regulations        applicable to the handling of Dangerous Goods.

Each Party agrees to promptly advise the        other of any changes to its Dangerous Goods Handling Procedures.\n\n14.0   RECORDS AND REPORTS    14.1   Each Party shall maintain performance reports, comparing actual to        scheduled departure and arrival times for Services provided. Such        reports shall be made available for review by the other Party and in        connection with same, a Party shall provide copies of all data and        records relating thereto.\n\n11                                      - 11 -\n\n14.2   Each Party shall maintain complete maintenance and operational records.\n\n14.3   Each Party shall keep accurate books, accounts and records covering all         transactions relating to this Agreement, including books of original        entry, and upon request from the other Party, shall allow access to        same.\n\n14.4   Either Party shall have the right to request the other to provide,        through an auditor agreed to by the Parties, validation of the        information and data referred to herein.\n\n15.0   CONTINGENCY PLANS\n\n15.1   In the event a Party is unable to provide the Services as a result of a        strike or other labour disruption caused by its employees, it shall              attempt to subcontract the Services to another operator or operators,        acceptable to the other Party. Such Services shall be provided by such        subcontractor/subcontractors on the same terms and conditions herein set        out and will be continued to be provided during the period of any such        strike or labour disruption, unless this Agreement is otherwise        terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. It is        understood and agreed that, if such Party provides the Services by        subcontracting to another operator/operators, then it shall be deemed        not to be in default pursuant to paragraph 17.1(c). Notwithstanding        same, all other default provisions as set out in paragraph 17, continue        to apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.0   SERVICE FAILURE REMEDIES\n\n16.1   In the event that Monthly Performance Failures occur more than three (3)        times in any twelve (12) month period, an Event of Default shall have         occurred.\n\n17.0   DEFAULT PROVISIONS\n\n17.1   For the purposes of this Agreement, the following shall constitute        events of default by a Party (hereinafter referred to as \"Events of         Default\"):\n\n    (a)     if a petition is filed against it under any applicable bankruptcy                legislation and is not withdrawn or dismissed within sixty                (60) days thereafter;\n\n    (b)     if a resolution is passed by it respecting the sale of all or                substantially all of its assets, or an order for the winding                 up of its business is made, or it otherwise agrees to make a                 bulk sale of it's assets;\n\n    (c)     if it ceases or threatens to cease to carry on its business;\n\n12                                      - 12 -\n\n     (d)     if it commits or threatens to commit an act of bankruptcy, or                 if it becomes insolvent or bankrupt or makes an assignment or if                 a receiver or receiver manager is appointed in respect of its                 business and affairs of either by way of private instrument or                 through court proceedings;\n\n     (e)     if a judgment or order is entered with respect to it under the                 Company Creditors Arrangement Act R.S.C. 1985, Chapter C-36, as                 amended, or similar legislation, or it takes advantage of the                 provisions of any bankruptcy or insolvency legislation;\n\n     (f)     if any execution, or any other process of any court becomes                 enforceable against all or substantially all of it's property or                 if a distress or analogous process is levied against all or                 substantially all of its property;\n\n     (g)     if it is in default as per paragraph 16.1 hereof; or\n\n     (h)     if it otherwise neglects or fails to perform or observe any of                 its obligations under this Agreement and fails to cure the                 breach or default within thirty (30) days of written notice to                 the other Party.\n\n17.2    Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and in addition to any         rights or remedies available to it under this Agreement or at law or in         equity, the Party not in default may exercise any or all of the         following remedies:\n\n     (a)     terminate this Agreement, upon giving one hundred and twenty                 (120) days written notice, otherwise upon written notice with                 respect to 17.1 (g) and (h);\n\n     (b)     recover from the defaulting Party any and all monies then due                 and to become due;

PRIMARY SPONSOR. For the 1998 racing season, Logan's shall be the primary sponsor of the Team, which fields a LMSC racing vehicle (the \"Race Car\") driven by Brad Baker. During the term of this Agreement, SRP will not represent any other product or company or accept as a primary, secondary, associate or contingent decal sponsor any other product reasonably deemed by Logan's to be competitive with Logan's.\n\n      2. TERM. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof  and, unless terminated as provided herein, shall continue through November 30, 1998.\n\n      3. SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY SRP.

Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,  Brad Baker (\"Baker\") will be the only driver for the Team for the term of this Agreement. If Baker is unavailable to perform as driver as a result of injury, illness or any other disability, or cause beyond his control, SRP shall provide an alternate driver subject to the approval of Logan's (\"Alternate Driver\"), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Baker and any Alternate Driver appointed by SRP and approved by Logan's pursuant to this Agreement are herein collectively\n\n                                    1    2\n\nreferred to as the \"Driver.\" The Driver shall not drive for any other sponsor which competes with Logan's. The Driver shall not drive any other race vehicle for any other sponsor than Logan's without prior written notice from SRP to Logan's.\n\n               (B) ADVERTISING, ENDORSEMENTS, ETC. Unless otherwise provided  in this Agreement, Logan's shall have the right at no additional expense to use the name, likeness and voice of Baker for endorsements, advertising and promotions in all forms of media.\n\n               (C) PUBLIC IMAGE. SRP shall be primarily responsible for developing and maintaining a positive public image for the Driver and the Team. To facilitate this aim and in recognition of Logan's sensitivity to any adverse publicity with respect to the Driver and the Racing Team, SRP shall be responsible for the public image of the Driver and the Racing Team at all times, including but not limited to any statement by the Driver or the Team in connection with press conferences, media contact and any contact of the Driver or Team with the general public, whether at a race or otherwise.\n\n               (D) CAR DESIGN. Consistent with NASCAR rules and regulations and the terms of Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement, SRP will develop a graphic design for the Race Car (the \"Graphic Design\").

SRP will provide race day uniforms for up to a maximum of 12 personnel and a driver suit for the Driver. Consistent with the NASCAR rules and regulations, and excluding any patches required by NASCAR, Logan's shall have the exclusive right to promote its Logan's logo on uniforms and Driver's suit on the areas depicted on Exhibit A to this Agreement. Logan's also shall have the exclusive right to promote its Logan's trademark on the side of the helmet, as shown on Exhibit B to this Agreement.

The Driver shall not appear in a race uniform or driving suit other than the\n\n\n\n\n\nLogan's uniform/suit in connection with or portraying involvement in NASCAR LMSC racing, whether or not used in product advertising or promotion.\n\n               (F) CREDENTIALS. At the request of Logan's and consistent with NASCAR and race track rules, regulations and procedures, SRP will use best efforts to secure credentials for the pre-race admissions of a maximum of four designees of Logan's to pit row and/or the garage area of each regularly scheduled or special LMSC event in which the Race Car competes.\n\n               (G) SHOW CAR. SRP will build and provide to Logan's a 1997 Ford Thunderbird automobile (\"Show Car\") that will have an appearance identical to\n\n                                    2\n\n3\n\nthat of the race car, to include full roll cage, race interior, paint, graphics and under-hood race look. Logan's will provide equipment and driver to transport the Show Car to destinations and according to schedules as determined by Logan's. At the expiration of this contract, Logan's will return the Show Car to SRP in substantially the same condition as when received by Logan's, normal wear and tear excepted.\n\n         (H) TRANSPORTER. SRP is attempting to purchase or lease a 53 foot  semi-trailer to be pulled by a Peterbilt class eight tractor which will function as the Race Car transporter (the \"Transporter\"). In the event SRP is successful in procuring the Transporter, it will be lettered and pictured with Logan's racing graphics by SRP up to a maximum cost allowance of Two Thousand Five Hundred and No/100's ($2,500.00), with Logan's retaining the right to apply more extensive graphics at its own expense if Logan's so chooses. Any associate sponsor graphics appearing on the Transporter will be displayed in a subservient manner to clearly reflect Logan's as the primary sponsor of the Team.\n\n         (I) AUTHORITY OF SRP.  SRP hereby warrants that it has the authority to grant all rights to Baker under this Article 3.\n\n      4. ASSOCIATE AND SECONDARY SPONSORSHIPS. SRP shall have the right to obtain secondary and associate sponsors for the Race Car and Team, subject to the approval of Logan's, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. SRP may not obtain any associate or secondary sponsors whose products or concepts compete with Logan's.

Logan's shall have the exclusive use of the hood, the rear quarter panel area above the tire and the bottom of the deck lid (rear facing panel, TV panel) of the Race Car, as shown on Exhibit C to this Agreement. All other areas permitted by NASCAR for sponsor signage, logos or trademarks and the \"spoiler space\" are reserved for NASCAR, SRP and the associate and secondary sponsors. All associate and secondary sponsors' graphic layouts for the Race Car are subject to Logan's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, SRP shall not permit any associate or secondary sponsor to suggest in any manner that its sponsorship role is as great as that of Logan's.\n\n      5. CONTINGENT SPONSORS.

SRP acknowledges that such required decals shall be placed forward of the\n\n                                    3\n\n4\n\ndoor panel, or as otherwise required by NASCAR rules and regulations, in a way not to detract from Logan's signage.\n\n      6.

The parties acknowledge that the market   for the SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be   difficult to ascertain market conditions for the purposes of reviewing such   commercial terms. Accordingly, the parties shall take cognisance of market   conditions in other countries where the SOFTWARE is being used. Should   the parties be unable to agree upon any such amendments within 30 days   from the end of each year if any, then such dispute shall be referred for   determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa (\"AFSA\") in   accordance with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the   Chairperson of AFSA upon application by either party.

TELKOM agrees, however, that such TELKOM extension or   TELKOM modification will be used solely in connection with TELKOM and its   AFFILIATES' business operations and that such TELKOM extension or TELKOM   modification will not be marketed, licensed or sublicensed, sold, assigned, or   otherwise transferred or made available to any third party or other entity, without   the express prior written consent of SAP AFRICA.

The parties hereto agree that the granting of any rights, title or interest to   TELKOM in any extension or modification (including TELKOM extensions and   TELKOM modifications) shall not be construed by the parties hereto or any court   of law to mean that SAP AFRICA has granted or given up any rights, title, or   interest in or to SAP AFRICA'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION or any part   thereof.   8. 5.   TELKOM agrees that it will not modify any third party SOFTWARE provided in   terms of this AGREEMENT, unless expressly authorised in writing by such third   party vendor and SAP AFRICA.\n\n\n\n- 23 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   8. 6.

It is conditional upon TELKOM receiving   Maintenance Service that TELKOM must make all required remote support and   connections to the DESIGNATED UNIT, at its expense, as reasonably requested   by SAP AFRICA. It is recorded that, unless the parties should agree otherwise,   such remote access shall be by a dial - up facility only.   9. 2     The Maintenance Services to be provided by SAP AFRICA shall not include any   services other than those contemplated in clause 9. 1 and those set out in\n\n\n\n- 24 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   annexure 2. Maintenance Services will be offered only for the current VERSION   and RELEASE and the immediately preceding VERSION and RELEASE. SAP   AFRICA shall use its best endeavours to provide Maintenance Services in   respect of earlier VERSIONS and/or RELEASES provided that should SAP   AFRICA and its licensors incur material costs in supporting such prior   RELEASES and/or VERSIONS, then the parties shall negotiate with each other,   observing the principles of good faith, to agree upon additional maintenance fees   payable by TELKOM in respect of such prior RELEASES and/or VERSIONS.   9. 3    Upon TELKOM'S request and provided that TELKOM has paid the Maintenance   Fee due to SAP AFRICA, SAP AFRICA shall, deliver new RELEASES and   VERSIONS and related DOCUMENTATION to the DESIGNATED SITES at no *   extra cost to TELKOM. Maintenance Service does not include the delivery of any   SOFTWARE and DOCUMENTATION that SAP AFRICA offers as separate   products and/or which have not been licensed in terms of this AGREEMENT.   9. 4      All other maintenance, consulting or related services not referred to in this clause 9   and/or in annexure 2, shall be agreed upon separately in writing and shall be   subject to agreed additional charges.   Maintenance Fees and Payment   9. 5     As consideration for providing the maintenance services, TELKOM shall pay to   SAP AFRICA an annual fee, that shall be calculated as a percentage of the   agreed License Fee, expressed in USD, for the SOFTWARE as specified in   annexure 1 hereto. Such percentage is stipulated in the annexure 2 hereto   (\"the Maintenance Fee\"). TELKOM shall pay the Maintenance Fee annually in   advance, in ZAR, calculated at the ruling USD: ZAR rate of exchange on the\n\n\n\n- 25 -  TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   date of invoice and otherwise in accordance with the other terms of payment   set out in this AGREEMENT and annexure 2.   9. 6    SAP AFRICA shall be entitled, upon 3 months written notice, to increase the   Maintenance Fee by increasing the percentage upon which the Maintenance   Fee is calculated or, on another basis provided that any increase to the   Maintenance Fee, caused by a combination of increases arising from:   9. 6. 1       inflation; and/or   9. 6. 2       the percentage at which the Maintenance Fee is calculated; and/or   9. 6. 3       USD/ZAR exchange rate movements,   shall not be greater than the annual increase in the South African   Consumer Price Index for all areas for the immediately preceding year (\"the   CPI\"), as published by the Central Statistics Agency of South Africa, or its   successors. However, should the Maintenance Fee not be increased by   the full extent of the CPI for any one year then, future increases to the   Maintenance Fee shall not exceed the difference between the actual   increases to the maintenance fee and the cumulative effect of the annual   increases in the CPI, for the immediately preceding thirty six consecutive   months period.   9. 7    The Maintenance Services may be terminated by TELKOM in writing at   any time upon 3 (three) months prior written notice. Subject to any   accrued rights and obligations, SAP AFRICA shall be entitled to   terminate the provision of Maintenance Services in respect of the   SOFTWARE or any modules thereof in the event of:\n\n\n\n- 26 -                                             TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   9. 7. 1           an unremedied material breach of this AGREEMENT by TELKOM;   and/or   9. 7. 2             should SAP AFRICA, SAP AG or their respective licensors, cease, for   whatever reason, providing such Maintenance Services,   provided that in the latter case, SAP AFRICA and /or SAP AG shall procure   that COMMERCE ONE INC..

The Maintenance Fee shall be calculated at 17% of the License fee stipulated in          annexure 1 for the license of the SOFTWARE.   2.     MAINTENANCE SERVICES   SAP Africa (\"SAP\") endeavours to provide the highest quality support and to ensure system stability throughout the life cycle of the Software solution. TELKOM will benefit through a lower total cost of ownership and will, in the future, experience an optimal usage of system resources and protection of existing investments.            7 x 24h Support Worldwide   SAP Customer Support delivers help for software problems in a fast and competent manner. SAP provides a 7 x 24h Support availability for messages with 'very high' priority using the 'Follow-the-Sun' model. At any given time of day an expert will be at hand to provide advice.   All Support centres are linked through a unique Support infrastructure, ensuring that all information provided to SAP is on hand regardless where or when.\n\n\n\n- 58 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Software Maintenance   Software Maintenance includes the further improvement of the software, as well as the continuous adaptation of the software to new database and operating system versions.  Each new release contains solutions to all known software errors.   Delivery of Functional Enhancements and Updates to the R/3 Software   SAP and its Licensors continuously enhance and improve the Software to ensure that Licensees customers always have the latest technology and business functions (e. g. functionality supporting the introduction of the Euro). SAP ensures that customers always receive the latest release of the R/3 software as soon as it becomes available.    Integrated Support for SAP and Partner Products   SAP maintains Collaborative Support Agreements with SAP Partners who have provided Licensees with hardware, operating system and database platforms to ensure seamless support. Should a Licensee request SAP require the involvement of the respective partner, SAP has established interfaces and procedures to do so.    Access to 'SAP's Frontend (formerly: OSS)   SAP'sFrontend is a quick and user-friendly interface for communication between customers and SAP. Features include:   - Access to the Software Support Package repository for downloads   - Database access to individual problem solutions for downloads   - Knowledge Database access to a wealth of information on the use of the Software   - Electronic notification about important information (HotNews)   - Access to SAP's request handling process.   Support Services   The requirement for deriving the full benefit from SAP's Global Support Network is a remote connection from the customer's Software System to SAP's Frontend. This enables the efficient usage of SAP's portfolio of Remote Services and will enable customers to work with the SAP Support experts whenever required and in particular, at the start of their\n\n\n\n- 59 -     TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01   implementation. Also, a remote connection is a prerequisite for 7 x 24h support for priority 1 messages.   Under the TeamSAP Support maintenance agreement, SAP Support deals with problem messages pertaining to:   - An error in the software   - An error in the software causes subsequent errors   - There are problems when implementing corrections   - There is no training or documentation available   - The functions are not logical   - The software ergonomics has flaws   Messages of this nature are responded to in writing via SAP's Frontend.   Any other messages are termed consulting issues and may be processed by either SAP's Remote Consulting department, the customer's implementation consultants or SAP consultants. This service is, however, priced separately and is not within scope of the maintenance agreement. Messages of this nature usually concern:   -  Processing logic of the software, the business processes and customising (questions  regarding working with transactions, programs and screens, the contents of screens  and  pr in touts ,   e tc .   )   - Administration or tuning of the SAP System, of the database or the operating system   - Errors caused by a modification of the system   - A solution is clear from the short text or from the help text of the system error   Maintenance Service Levels   Optimum support with fast reaction times is the cornerstone of SAP's Support organisation. SAP's Support process uses a three-tier Support structure:    Local Support (in 50 countries worldwide)   Local Support Centres at SAP subsidiaries are the local contact points for customers. During usual working hours, the Local Support Centres handle all inquiries relating to support in the language of the respective country and, if necessary, forward them to the\n\n\n\n-60-    TELKOM CONTRACT NO. 076C/01    appropriate local partner or the nearest Regional Support Centre. Most inquiries are entered via SAP 's Frontend which offers all the advantages of automatic dispatching.    Regional Support (more than 400 Support professionals in four Regional Support Centres)   Regional Support Centres are located in Walldorf, Germany (Europe/Africa), Philadelphia, USA (Americas), Singapore (Asia-Pacific) and Tokyo, Japan (North East Asia). These Centres are responsible for processing support inquiries and also form part of the 7 x 24h support network. According to the 'FoIlow-the-Sun' principle, inquiries received outside normal working hours are automatically forwarded to the Regional Support Centre that is currently active. Another task is the co-ordination of regional partners in their co-operation with SAP customers.    Development Support (Europe, Americas, Asia)   SAP Africa's Local Support Centre supports all SAP customers in the Southern Africa/Sub- Sahara region. In the event of SAP Africa being unable to respond timeously or effectively, the support query will be elevated to COMMERCE ONE INC.. Inc. consultants, in which event, SAP Africa shall use its best endeavours to respond timeously in accordance with the service levels stipulated in the table below.   The Quality Management processes implemented throughout the SAP Support organisation are certified globally according to the international standard ISO 9002.   The workflow between the support levels is defined in an internal Support Level Agreement (SLA) and SAP's Support Process Monitoring team ensures that requests are forwarded smoothly between the support levels. SAP Africa, SAP AG and their respective licensors shall use their best endeavours and efforts to ensure that the below mentioned Initial Reaction Times and Projected Resolution Times (\"PRT\") are achieved in 80% of all cases;   Priority   Very High (1)   High (2)   Medium (3)   Low (4)   Initial Reaction Time   (IRT)   30 minutes   2 hours   4 hours   8 hours   Projected Resolution Time   (PRT)   1 day   3 days   7 days   1 4 days   Priority 1: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes in actual time Priority 2, 3, 4: d, h, min = days, hours, minutes during office hours\n\n\n\n- 61 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   The initial reaction time (IRT) is the time elapsed between message receipt at SAP (\"Send to SAP\" in SAP Service System) and initial contact with the customer or change of the message status.   The Projected Resolution Time (PRT) is the time elapsed between IRT and providing a solution.   Priorities of messages are defined as follows:    Very High or Priority 1   A message with priority \"Very high\" is justified when critical restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Critical tasks, especially time-critical jobs, cannot be performed, due to a total system shutdown or a malfunction in a main function of the production SAP system.   This message requires immediate processing, as the malfunction can result in serious losses.    High or Priority 2   A message with priority \"High\" is justified when serious restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. Necessary tasks cannot be performed due to a malfunction or failed function in the Software that is urgently required in the current situation.   The message requires rapid processing, because the continuing malfunction could cause a serious interruption in the entire production system.    Medium or Priority 3   A message with priority \"Medium\" is justified when restrictions in day-to-day operations are encountered. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system.    Low or Priority 4   A message with priority \"Low\" is justified when day-to-day operations are not affected or only affected in a minor fashion. This is caused by a malfunction or failed functionality in the system that is not used daily or is only used rarely.   (Problem situations in test systems will normally result in a priority that is one level lower than the identical problem in a production system).\n\n\n\n- 62 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   On the anniversary of this AGREEMENT, the parties shall enter into discussions and   negotiations for the purposes of reviewing the aforestated maintenance service level terms,   more particularly, the related commercial terms thereof including, the maintenance fee and/or   percentages; the response, processing and resolution times; the penalties that may be   payable by SAP Africa and/or its licensors for failing to comply with such times and other   aspects of the maintenance services. The parties acknowledge that the market for the   SOFTWARE in South Africa is limited and that therefor it may be difficult to ascertain market   conditions for the purposes of reviewing such commercial and related terms. Accordingly,   the parties shall take cognisance of market conditions in other countries where the   SOFTWARE is being used. Should the parties be unable to agree upon any such   amendments within 30 days from the anniversary date, then such dispute shall be referred   for determination by the Arbitration Foundation of Southern Africa (\"AFSA\") in accordance   with the rules of AFSA and to an arbitrator appointed by the Chairperson of AFSA upon   application by either party. The arbitrator shall upon request of either party, appoint a   suitably qualified expert to assist him in determining the dispute. Except in the case of   manifest error, the arbitrators' ruling shall be final and binding upon the parties but shall be   without prejudice to a party's other rights and obligations arising from the AGREEMENT.\n\n\n\n- 6 3 -    TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01     Customer Message Support   The process of customer message support is the interface between development and service. The process steps that impact upon the SLA are customer message recording, preliminary checking, search for relevant error notes (known problem solution), and problem analysis.   Life Cycle of a Customer Message   Refer to accompanying PDF for diagram    Telkom customers can access the SAP's Frontend or SAPNet-Web Frontend and create their own requests and messages. Customer requests and messages that are received in writing via fax (+27 11 2356004) are first processed by the support facility of the Local Support Centre and then recorded for further processing in SAP's internal customer support system. A request or message is automatically assigned to an administrator in the SAP support organization (Local Support and Regional Support for the Software) based on the components assigned to it.   Performing preliminary checks, searching for troubleshooting information   The processor first checks whether the problem report is complete, and whether an entry has already been made in the system containing a solution to the reported problem. This search is conducted semi-automatically in SAP's support system. If an entry is found containing a solution to the problem, then the person who had submitted the problem report is notified in writing via SAPNet and the problem is closed for SAP.   Problem Analysis   If, following preliminary analysis, the Local Support level decides that the problem must be handled by an expert in the respective component, the problem is passed on to the Regional\n\n\n\n- 64 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   Support level. If the problem involves a program error or if the processor cannot find a solution despite intensive analysis, he or she transfers it to the Development Support level. The responsibility for Development Support lies with the user departments of the development areas.   If no relevant error note (known solution) exists, the customer shall provide SAP with sufficient test time and support, as an attempt is made to reproduce the reported problem and to determine whether it is a problem with the software (at SAP or in the customer's system, provided that the latter does not negatively affect the customer's operations). If this reproduction of the problem is not possible, the next time the problem occurs, additional analyses are performed to narrow down the source of the problem. In the meantime, the problem receives the status of \"customer action\" in the support system. If special handling by an expert is required, then it is relayed to Development Support.   Escalation Management   In the event of SAP's Support Management deciding that the standard support processes are insufficient to solve a critical customer situation (problems as described in point 2 above) a formal escalation process is invoked.   During this process, SAP will assign the required SAP personnel to the customer remotely (via a remote connection) and/or on site, as appropriate. These resources will be under the direct supervision of SAP's management and the customer will not incur any costs.   A formal de-escalation process, involving an assigned Customer Services Manager, will take place once the critical issue has been resolved.   During the implementation phase prior to the SOFTWARE being installed, SAP AFRICA and TELKOM will negotiate with each other to discuss and agree upon an appropriate detailed escalation process for the Maintenance Services that SAP AFRICA and its licensors will provide and that will apply during the said implementation phase and the \"go-live\" stage. The parties shall also determine an escalation process that is appropriate for TELKOM'S needs and business requirements when USING the SOFTWARE.\n\n\n\n-65-    TELKOM CONTRACTN0. 076C/01   THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  WOODMEAD  by SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS   (AFRICA) (PROPRIETARY) LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001    /S/                  /S/                                                   (who warrants his authority to so sign)   For:  TELKOM  SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED             (who warrants his authority to so sign)   /s/                                                                THUS DONE AND SIGNED at  Pretoria by the TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED    on this 31st day of  March 2001 in the presence of the undersigned witnesses       AS WITNESSES     Signature         /S/        Signature         /S/\n\n\n\n- 66 -     TELKOM CONTRACT No. 076C/01   ANNEXURE 3   to   AGREEMENT   between   SYSTEMS APPLICATION PRODUCTS (AFRICA) (PTY) LTD   with   TELKOM SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED   1.

If Company fails to achieve the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement in any Detailing Period, Janssen shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice, unless:\n\n(a) Company complied with and performed its Detailing activities in accordance with any Remediation Plans developed by Company and approved by Janssen during such Detailing Period; or\n\n(b) if (i) neither Party provided a Performance Failure Notice under Section 3.2.4 during such Detailing Period and (ii) Company performs additional Details in the first month after such Detailing Period such that, if such Details had been performed during such Detailing Period, they would have been sufficient to cure the failure to achieve the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement, as applicable. To avoid double-counting, such additional Details will not be taken into account when determining whether Company satisfies the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement in the then-current Detailing Period.\n\nFor clarity, (i) Company must achieve all of the applicable foregoing minimum requirements in order to avoid giving rise to Janssen's rights and remedies under this Section 3.2.3, and (ii) such rights shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available to Janssen under applicable Laws in the event of any such failure on the part of Company.\n\n3.2.4 Monthly Detailing Reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) No later than [***] ([***]) Business Days following the end of each month during the Term, Company shall report to Janssen the number of Details performed (and any other information necessary to determine whether the requirements set forth in Section 3.2.2 and Exhibit B have been satisfied) during such month by the Sales Representatives in accordance with this Agreement and the Call Plan, as reported by the Company Internal Detail Reporting System. The Joint Commercial Team shall review and discuss Company's performance of its Detailing obligations on a monthly basis.\n\n(b) In the event that either Party believes, based on such reports, review or discussion, that Company will fail to achieve the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement under Section 3.2.2 for the then-current Detailing Period, such Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing (a \"Performance Failure Notice\") and Company shall develop a plan to avoid such a failure within fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the applicable month, which plan will be subject to Janssen's approval, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (as so approved, a \"Remediation Plan\").\n\n(c) For clarity, the Joint Commercial Team shall have no authority to extend the time for performance or reduce the Minimum Number of Details Requirement, the Minimum Reach Requirement or, if applicable, the Minimum PDE Requirement or the Minimum Top Target Requirement without an amendment to this Agreement.\n\n3.2.5 Ride-Alongs.

In either event, Company shall provide Janssen with a plan to continue meeting the Minimum Number of Details Requirements, Minimum Reach Requirements, Minimum PDE Requirements and, if applicable, Minimum Top Target Requirements under Section 3.2.2.\n\n(c) If the average number of Sales Representatives on the Sales Force is less than twenty-five (25) over any forty-five (45)-day period, Janssen will have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' notice.\n\n3.3.3 Subcontracting.

If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of an Action, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense.\n\n12.2.3 The Party not controlling such defense shall reasonably cooperate with the other Party at such other Party's request and expense, and may participate therein at its own expense; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to such Action, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection with such Action; provided further, however, that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties.\n\n12.2.4 The Party controlling such defense shall keep the other Party advised of the status of such Action and the defense thereof and shall consider recommendations made by the other Party with respect thereto.\n\n12.2.5 The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Action, consent to any judgment in respect thereof or admit any liability with respect thereto, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.\n\n12.2.6 The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of such Action or consent to any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that no such consent shall be required with respect to any such settlement, compromise or consent to judgment that (a) involves solely the payment of money damages as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged its obligation to indemnify hereunder, (b) does not involve any claim for injunctive\n\n\n\n\n\nor other equitable relief, and (c) effects a full and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party with respect to all claims related to the Action.\n\n12.3 Limitations on Liability. SUBJECT TO AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS UNDER SECTIONS 12.1 AND 12.2, AND EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITY ARISING FROM BREACH OF SECTION 9.1 BY A PARTY, NO PARTY OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER ANY CONTRACT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, MULTIPLIED OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR OTHER DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, SALES OR FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER.

All disputes, claims or controversies (other than matters that are expressly stated herein to require the consent of either or both Parties) arising from or related to this Agreement, or to the interpretation, application, breach, termination or validity of this Agreement, whether based on contract, tort, statute, or other theory of liability (\"Disputes\"), shall be resolved in accordance with this Article XIII. It is the intent of the Parties that all Disputes relating in any way to this Agreement should be resolved in accordance with this Article, including Disputes that may involve the parent companies, subsidiaries, and other Affiliates of any Party.\n\n13.2 Negotiation. Before any Dispute may be submitted to mediation or arbitration as provided below, the Dispute shall be referred to the President of Janssen and the Chief Executive Officer of Company for discussion and attempted resolution. No statements made by either Party during such discussions will be used by the other Party or admissible in arbitration or any other\n\n\n\n\n\nsubsequent proceeding for resolving the dispute. If such executives do not resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days of such referral by either Party, then either Party may, upon written notice to the other Party, submit the Dispute to mediation pursuant to Section 13.3 and binding arbitration pursuant to Section 13.4.\n\n13.3 Mediation.\n\n13.3.1 The Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to Section 13.2 by confidential mediation in accordance with the then current Mediation Procedure of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution (\"CPR Mediation Procedure\") (http://www.cpradr.org) before initiating arbitration. The CPR Mediation Procedure shall control, except where the CPR Mediation Procedure conflicts with these provisions, in which case these provisions control. The mediator shall be chosen pursuant to the CPR Mediation Procedure. The mediation shall be conducted in English in New York, New York. At the request of either Party (and at the shared expense of the Parties), the mediation shall have simultaneous translation from and into English.\n\n13.3.2 Either Party may initiate mediation with respect to any Dispute that is not resolved pursuant to Section 13.2 by written notice to the other Party. The Parties agree to select the mediator within twenty (20) days of the notice and the mediation will begin promptly after the selection. The mediation will continue until the mediator or either Party, declares in writing, no sooner than after the conclusion of one full day of a substantive mediation conference attended on behalf of each Party by a senior business person with authority to resolve the Dispute, that the Dispute cannot be resolved by mediation. In no event, however, shall mediation continue more than sixty (60) days from the initial notice by a Party to initiate meditation unless the Parties agree in writing to extend that period.\n\n13.3.3 Any period of limitations that would otherwise expire between the initiation of mediation and its conclusion shall be extended until twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the mediation.\n\n13.4 Arbitration. If the Parties fail to resolve a Dispute by mediation under Section 13.3 and either Party desires to pursue resolution of the Dispute, the Dispute shall be submitted by either Party for resolution in arbitration pursuant to the then current CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration of International Disputes (\"CPR Rules\") (http://www.cpradr.org), except where they conflict with these provisions, in which case these provisions control. CPR is designated as the Neutral Organization for all purposes.\n\n13.4.1 Language/Location. The arbitration shall be conducted in English in New York, New York.\n\n13.4.2 Selection of Arbitrators.\n\n(a) The arbitrators will be chosen from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals, unless a candidate not on the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals is approved by both\n\n\n\n\n\nParties. Each arbitrator shall be a lawyer with at least fifteen (15) years' experience with a law firm or corporate law department of over twenty-five (25) lawyers or who was a judge of a court of general jurisdiction. To the extent that the Dispute requires special expertise, the Parties will so inform CPR prior to the beginning of the selection process.\n\n(b) The arbitration tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators, chosen in accordance with Rules 5.3 and 6 of the CPR Rules. If, however, the aggregate award sought by the Parties is less than five million United States dollars (USD $5,000,000) and equitable relief is not sought, a single arbitrator shall be chosen in accordance with Rules 5.3 and 6 of the CPR Rules.\n\n(c) Candidates for the arbitrator position(s) may be interviewed by representatives of the Parties in advance of their selection, provided that all Parties are represented.\n\n(d) The Parties agree to select the arbitrator(s) within forty-five (45) days of initiation of the arbitration.\n\n13.4.3 Conduct of Proceedings.\n\n(a) The hearing will be concluded within nine (9) months after selection of the arbitrator(s) and the award will be rendered within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing, or of any post hearing briefing, which briefing will be completed by both sides within 45 days after the conclusion of the hearing. In the event the Parties cannot agree upon a schedule, then the arbitrator(s) shall set the schedule following the time limits set forth above as closely as practical.\n\n(b) The arbitrator(s) shall be guided, but not bound, by the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration (www.ibanet.org).\n\n(c) The hearing will be concluded in ten hearing days or less. Multiple hearing days will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent possible. A transcript of the testimony adduced at the hearing shall be made and shall be made available to either Party.\n\n13.4.4 Applicable Law. The arbitrator(s) shall decide the merits of any Dispute in accordance with the law governing this Agreement, without application of any principle of conflict of laws that would result in reference to a different law. The arbitrator(s) may not apply principles such as \"amiable compositeur\" or \"natural justice and equity.\"\n\n13.4.5 Award.\n\n(a) The arbitrator(s) shall render a written opinion stating the reasons upon which the award is based. The arbitrator(s) may award the costs and expenses of the arbitration as provided in the CPR Rules, but each Party shall bear its own attorney fees.\n\n(b) The award may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. If a court is called upon to enforce an award in a court proceeding, the Parties consent\n\n\n\n\n\nto the court's requiring the Party resisting enforcement to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that proceeding by the Party seeking enforcement.\n\n13.4.6 Provisional Relief. Any Party may seek emergency, interim, or provisional relief prior to the appointment of the arbitrator(s) from any court of competent jurisdiction, without waiver of the agreements to mediate and arbitrate. After appointment of the arbitrator(s), any request for emergency, interim, or provisional relief shall either be addressed to the arbitrator(s), which shall have the power to enter an interim award granting relief using the standards provided by applicable law, or to a court, but only with the permission of the arbitrator(s). Any interim award of the arbitrator(s) may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n13.4.7 WAIVER. EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES: (A) ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY, (B) WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RELIEF MANDATED BY STATUTE, ANY CLAIM FOR THE TYPES OF DAMAGES EXCLUDED BY SECTION 12.3 (SUBJECT TO THE EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN SUCH SECTION), AND (C) ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.\n\n13.5 Confidentiality. All proceedings and decisions of the mediator(s) and/or arbitrator(s) shall be deemed Confidential Information of each of the Parties and shall be subject to Section 9.1.\n\nARTICLE XIV MISCELLANEOUS\n\n14.1 Press Announcements. Neither Party, nor any of its Affiliates, shall issue any press release or make any other public statement relating to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the relationship contemplated hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party (or its applicable Affiliate) may make any disclosure relating to the Product or the terms and conditions of this Agreement that such Party (or Affiliate), in the opinion of its counsel, is obligated to make pursuant to Laws applicable to publicly-traded companies, including, inter alia, regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market. In such event, the announcement shall be brief and factual (to the extent consistent with applicable Laws), and the Party required to make such disclosure shall, to the extent practicable, notify the other Party of the method and content of such disclosure a reasonable period of time (at least five (5) Business Days if possible) in advance thereof, so as to allow such other Party to review it for the use of its name and disclosure of Confidential Information.\n\n14.2 Force Majeure Event. All incidents of force majeure, being circumstances beyond the reasonable control of either Party and which have, or may have, a material effect on the ability of such Party to perform under this Agreement, including, failure of power or other utility or sanitary supplies; fire; flood; earthquake; other natural disaster; explosion; riot; strike or lock-out of such Party's workforce; civil insurrection or unrest; terrorist activity; war (whether declared or not); and regulations of any Governmental Authority, in each case, to the extent beyond the\n\n\n\n\n\nreasonable control of such Party (\"Force Majeure\"), shall, for the duration and to the extent of the effects caused thereby, release such Party from the performance of its contractual obligations hereunder. The Party who has suffered the Force Majeure shall notify the other Party without delay of any such incident(s) occurring, and the Parties shall discuss the effects and extent of such incident(s) on this Agreement and the measures to be taken. Each Party shall use Diligent Efforts to avoid or restrict Force Majeure and to mitigate any loss therefrom. In the event of an incident or incidents of Force Majeure, the Party whose performance has been affected thereby shall as soon as reasonably possible resume performance of its obligations hereunder. If any Force Majeure substantially prevents, hinders, or delays performance by a Party in a manner and to an extent that would, but for this Section, constitute a material breach or give rise to a right of termination hereunder, and the performance is not materially restored within one hundred eighty (180) days, the other Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to such Party.\n\n14.3 Independent Contractors. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or imply an association, partnership, or joint venture between the Parties, it being agreed and understood that the Parties are independent contractors; and neither Party, with respect to a Third Party, shall have the power or authority to bind or obligate the other Party in any way. Neither Party shall have any responsibility for the hiring, termination or compensation of the other Party's employees or for any employee benefits of such employee. No employee or representative of a Party shall have any authority to bind or obligate the other Party to this Agreement for any sum or in any manner whatsoever, or to create or impose any contractual or other liability on the other Party without said Party's approval.\n\n14.4 Performance by Affiliates. To the extent that this Agreement purports to impose obligations on the Affiliates of a Party, such Party agrees to cause its Affiliates to perform such obligations. Company shall not use an Affiliate to exercise any of its rights or perform any of its obligations or duties hereunder without Janssen's prior written consent. Janssen may use an Affiliate to exercise its rights or perform its obligations and duties hereunder with prior written notice to Company. If either Janssen or Company uses an Affiliate to exercise any of its rights or perform any of its obligations or duties hereunder, as the case may be, such Party shall remain liable hereunder for the prompt payment and performance of all of its obligations hereunder.\n\n14.5 Notices.\n\n14.5.1 All notices, statements, requests or other documents that either Party shall be required or shall desire to give to the other hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by the Parties only as follows: (a) by personal delivery; (b) by facsimile, receipt confirmed; (c) by addressing it as indicated below, and by depositing it certified mail, postage prepaid, in the mail, first class (airmail if the address is outside of the country in which such notice is deposited); or (d) by addressing it as indicated below, and by delivering it toll prepaid to a recognized courier service (e.g., Federal Express or DHL).\n\n14.5.2 If so delivered, transmitted by facsimile, mailed, or couriered, each such notice, statement, request or other document shall, except as herein expressly provided, be\n\n\n\n\n\nconclusively deemed to have been given when personally delivered or faxed during a Business Day, or on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date of mailing, or on the second (2nd) Business Day after delivery to a courier service, as the case may be.

Any attempted assignment, transfer or delegation not in accordance with this Section shall be void.\n\n14.8 Non-Waiver of Rights.

This includes, but is not limited to, monitoring applicable AE, Special Situation, AEPQC and UE training, and maintaining documentation of such training. Such training shall be conducted in the manner set forth in the Agreement using materials to be provided by Janssen. Janssen may require Company Employees to complete additional training provided by Janssen when there is a change in the governing contracts and/or processes or changes in Company's personnel.\n\n5 [Intentionally Omitted.]\n\n5 Retention Policy\n\n5.1 Company shall maintain and archive records of all source documentation generated by the activity (records, questionnaires, reports), personnel training records and other relevant information relating to its obligations under this Schedule for a period consistent with Section 7.1 of the Agreement (including Exhibit C thereto) and Applicable Law. Company must have appropriate storage capabilities (e.g., preventing accidental damage of physical records and appropriate back up of electronic storage systems) if storing original AE, Special Situations, AEPQC and UE documentation.

Gregor,  chairman and chief executive officer of United National.  \"During the past year we completed an assessment of our  information  processing  needs going forward into the next  century.  After evaluating a number of different options, we determined that the flexibility and quality of BISYS'  TOTALPLUS (R) system would best serve our needs today and for years to come.\"\n\nUnited Financial  Services, a third party services provider that United National Bancorp owns with another joint venture  partner,  currently handles the Bank's information  processing  services,  item processing and deposit  services.  As a result of its planned move to BISYS,  United  National will be  liquidating  its interest  in United  Financial  Services  during the first half of 1999 after it goes live with BISYS.\n\n\"Our  investment  in United  Financial  Services  has made a great deal of sense since we established it in 1995,\" said Mr. Gregor.  \"United Financial  Services has allowed  United  National to realize  significant  efficiencies  through the sharing of technology and processing  costs.  Nevertheless,  we believe that the enhanced  capabilities  which  BISYS  offers  are  better  matched to the future direction of our Bank.\"\n\nContact:  media,  Donald  Reinhard,  908-429-2370 or investors,  Donald Malwitz, 908-429-2405,  both  of  United  National.",

FEES FOR ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.\n\n          In the event that Franchisee  meets Pretzel Time's  qualifications  to open  additional  Franchises at sites  acceptable to both Franchisee and Pretzel Time,  which  approval is at the sole  discretion of Pretzel  Time,  the initial franchisee  fee shall be the greater of FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ($5,000.00)(plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt  Product is included) or the then current fee for additional franchises set by Pretzel Time, at its sole discretion.

Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.\n\n         4.G.     FEES FOR RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that in consideration of the grant of the \"Successor Franchise\"  (defined in Section 5.A.),  Franchisee shall pay the current renewal fee as of the  date of  renewal  and  execute  a  general  release  in the  form prescribed  by Pretzel Time in  accordance  with Section 5.B. The renewal fee is due and payable thirty (30) days prior to the renewal day.\n\n         4.H.     PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER.\n\n         Franchisee agrees to pay all Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due Pretzel Time for purchases by Franchisee from Pretzel Time or its Affiliates and other amounts which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel Time via  electronic  funds transfer from Franchisee's general account,  which shall be initiated by Pretzel Time and any transfer fees shall be paid by Franchisee  every  Wednesday for the preceding week based upon the Net Revenues.  Franchisee herein agrees to execute and complete all necessary  documentation required by Pretzel Time to permit the wire transfer to Pretzel Time (in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit E or such other form as Pretzel Time shall accept). Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds\n\n\n\n\n\navailable to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.  If,  at any  time,  Pretzel  Time  determines  that  Franchisee  has under-reported the Unit's Net Revenues, or underpaid Royalty or Advertising Fund Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in arrears for the Unit.\n\n         4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.\n\n         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.\n\n5.

FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO A SUCCESSOR FRANCHISE.\n\n         Upon the expiration of the initial term of this  Agreement,  Franchisee shall  have the one time  right to obtain a  successor  franchise  to  operate a Pretzel  Time Unit at the Site (a  \"Successor  Franchise\")  for a single term of five (5) years  immediately  following the expiration of the initial term of the Franchise upon giving Pretzel Time six (6) months notice prior to the expiration of the then current term if:\n\n         (1) Franchisee and its Owners have complied with this Agreement and any          amendment  during the initial  term of this  Agreement  in all material          respects; and\n\n         (2) Franchisee  maintains  possession of the Site and agrees to remodel          and/or expand the Unit, add or replace equipment, furnishings, fixtures          and signs and  otherwise  modify  the Unit to bring it into  compliance          with   specifications  and  standards  then  applicable  under  new  or          Successor Franchises for Pretzel Time Units; or if Franchisee is unable          to maintain  possession  of the Site, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel          Time,  the Unit should be  relocated,  Franchisee  secures a substitute          site approved by Pretzel Time and agrees to develop  expeditiously such          substitute  site in compliance with  specifications  and standards then          applicable  under new or successor  franchises  for Pretzel Time units;          and\n\n         (3) Pretzel  Time has not given notice of its election not to renew six          (6) months  prior to the  expiration  of the  initial  twenty (20) year          term; and\n\n         (4)  Franchisee  is not in default of any material term or condition of          the lease  agreement,  or any other agreement  between Pretzel Time and          Franchisee; and\n\n         (5) Franchisee executes Pretzel Time's then current Franchise Agreement          and  other  ancillary  agreements  required  and being  offered  to new          Franchisees on the date of renewal, which agreements shall supersede in          all respects this  Agreement and the terms of which may differ from the          terms of this Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  Royalty Fees          and  Advertising  Fund  Fees,  other  fees  and  charges,   performance          criteria,  and a provision which allows Pretzel Time and its Affiliates          to reserve  the right,  both within and  outside of the  Territory,  to          offer and sell at wholesale or retail, through channels of distribution          distinct  from  those  of a  Franchise,  Products  and  services  which          comprise,  or may in the  future  comprise a part of the  Pretzel  Time          System, which Products may be resold at retail to the general public by          such entities; and\n\n         (6) Franchisee is in full  compliance  with Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual; and\n\n         (7) On renewal,  Franchisee  agrees to pay the current renewal fee, the          Royalty and  Advertising  Fund fees specified in Pretzel Time's current\n\n\n\n\n\n         Franchise  Agreement then being offered new  Franchisees on the date of          renewal; and\n\n         (8) Franchisee shall execute general releases,  in form satisfactory to          Pretzel  Time,  of any and all  claims  against  Pretzel  Time  and its          Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors          and assigns arising under this Agreement; and\n\n         (10)   Franchisee   has  complied  with  Pretzel  Time's  then  current          qualification and training requirements.\n\n         Following receipt of Franchisee's election to renew, Pretzel Time shall provide Franchisee with an execution copy of the form of Franchise  Agreement to be entered into for the renewal  term.  If the  Franchisee  does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.\n\n         Pretzel Time may, at its option, with reasonable cause and upon written notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the expiration  of the term of this  Agreement.  If  applicable  law  requires  that Pretzel Time give longer  notice to  Franchisee  prior to the  expiration of the term than is specified in the Franchise Agreement,  the Franchise Agreement will remain in effect on a  month-to-month  basis until the requisite notice has been given.\n\n         5.B.     RELEASES.\n\n         Franchisee  and its Owners  shall  execute  general  releases,  in form satisfactory  to Pretzel Time (the  general form of which is attached  hereto as Exhibit \"K\"), of any and all claims against  Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their  respective  shareholders,   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents, successors and assigns. Failure by Franchisee and its Owners to sign and deliver to Pretzel  Time,  such  agreements  and releases  within thirty (30) days after delivery  thereof to Franchisee shall be deemed an election by Franchisee not to obtain a Successor Franchise.\n\n         5.C.

RELOCATION.\n\n         In the event that  Franchisee's  lease is  terminated,  with or without fault of  Franchisee,  if the Site is damaged,  condemned or otherwise  rendered unusable as a Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with this Agreement, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel Time and  Franchisee,  there is a change in the character of the location of the Site sufficiently  detrimental to his business  potential to warrant its relocation,  Pretzel Time will not unreasonably  withhold permission for  relocation  of the  Unit  to  another  Site,  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's then-current  site  criteria,  subject to the rights of  existing  Pretzel  Time franchisees  under their  franchise  agreements  with Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time is under no  obligation  to approve a relocation of the Franchise.  However,  upon written approval from Pretzel Time, Franchisee may relocate the Franchise to another  location.  Such approval shall not be granted unless  Franchisee is in compliance with all terms and conditions of this  Agreement  and  Franchisee  has the  financial  resources  available to relocate the Unit and construct a new and  comparable  Unit according to Pretzel Time's then current design  standards.  Any such  relocation of the Franchise is subject to Pretzel Time's prior  approval of the new Unit  location.  Relocation shall be at  Franchisee's  sole expense and Pretzel Time shall have the right to charge  Franchisee  for  any and all  costs  incurred  by  Pretzel  Time,  and a reasonable  fee  for  its  services,  in  connection  with  any  such  approval, evaluation  and  relocation  of the  Franchise.  The Unit  shall  re-open at the replacement  Site as soon as  reasonably  practicable  but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the closing of the original location.\n\n8.

Franchisee  shall also submit all revised or \"as built\" plans and          specifications  during the course of such  construction upon request of          Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to pay for any and all architect fees          and pay the architectural fees for the architect to review, approve and          modify the plans.\n\n         8.B.

Franchisee further agrees to place or display at the Unit only such signs, emblems,  lettering,  logos and display  materials  that  Pretzel  Time  approves in writing  from time to time; provided,  however,  that  Pretzel  Time  shall  have  the  right,  in its  sole discretion,  to install  all  required  signs at the Unit at  Franchisee's  sole expense.  Franchisee shall purchase or lease approved brands, types or models of fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment and signs only from  suppliers  designated or approved by Pretzel Time (which may include Pretzel Time and/or its Affiliates). Franchisee  further agrees that all fixtures,  furnishings and equipment used in connection  with the operation of the Unit shall be free and clear of all liens, claims and  encumbrances  whatsoever,  except  with  respect to any such  liens, claims or  encumbrances  asserted by Pretzel Time or third party  purchase money security interests.\n\n         8.D.     EXCEPTIONS TO EQUIPMENT OR FURNISHINGS.\n\n         If Franchisee proposes to purchase any brand or type of construction or decorating material, fixture, equipment,  furniture or sign not then approved by Pretzel  Time,  or any such item from a supplier  which is not then  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time, in writing, and shall submit  to  Pretzel   Time,   upon  its  request,   sufficient   specifications, photographs,  drawings and other  information or samples for a determination  by Pretzel  Time of  whether  such  brand  or type of  construction  or  decorating material, fixture, equipment, furniture or sign complies with its specifications and standards or such supplier meets Pretzel Time's approved supplier  criteria, which  determination  shall be made and  communicated  in writing to  Franchisee within a reasonable time.

Failure to open the Unit within the aforementioned time period shall  result in the  termination  of this  Franchise  Agreement  and all franchise fees paid by Franchisee shall be nonrefundable.  Franchisee agrees not to open the Unit for business until the following has occurred:\n\n          (1). Pretzel  Time  approves  the  Unit  pursuant  to its  Pre-Opening                Checklist;\n\n          (2). Pre-opening  training of Franchisee  and Unit  personnel has been                completed to Pretzel Time's satisfaction;\n\n          (3).

FRANCHISEE TRAINING.\n\n         10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  (\"Unit Manager\") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.\n\n         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise, be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation, and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.\n\n         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.\n\n         All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.\n\n         10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.\n\n         Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.\n\n         Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.\n\n         10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.\n\n         Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new\n\n\n\n\n\ntechniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.\n\n         10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.\n\n         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:                             (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures                utilized by Pretzel Time Units;\n\n          (ii) Purchasing  required  fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment,  signs,                Products, materials and supplies;\n\n          (iii) Advertising and Promotional programs;\n\n          (iv) Employee training; and\n\n          (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and                management procedures.\n\nSuch guidance shall, in Pretzel Time's  discretion,  be furnished in the form of Pretzel  Time's  Operations  Manual,  bulletins  and  other  written  materials, electronic computer messages,  telephone  conversations  and/or consultations at Pretzel Time's offices or at the Unit. Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.\n\n11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.\n\n         11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.\n\n         Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory. At its initial opening, Pretzel Time, at  Franchisee's  expense,  shall  designate  and supply an initial  quantity of forms,  literature,   display,  and  promotional  materials.  Pretzel  Time,  in consideration of the Advertising Fund Fee, shall periodically provide Franchisee with  camera  ready  advertising  materials.   Multiple  copies  of  advertising materials will be furnished to Franchisee for an additional  fee,  including any related shipping, handling and storage charges.\n\n         11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.  Pretzel  Time may  expend, disburse and use funds from the Advertising  Fund, in its sole  discretion,  for the following purposes:\n\n                  (1) The  creation  and  development  of nonlocal  advertising,          promotional campaigns,  and public relations to promote and enhance the          value of the Service  Marks and the  business  of all the Pretzel  Time          retail establishments;\n\n                  (2) Payments to Pretzel Time of such reasonable sums as may be          necessary  for actual  costs of  advertising  production,  direct  mail          purchases, and other media marketing tools;\n\n                  (3) Payment of salaries and  benefits  for staff  personnel in          the  marketing  and  public  relations  department  as  well  as  other          administrative  costs and overhead expenses of the department  incurred          by Pretzel Time;\n\n                  (4) The  costs of  employing  advertising,  marketing,  public          relations and promotion  agencies to assist in preparing and conducting          media programs and activities and supporting public  relations,  market\n\n\n\n\n\n         research and other advertising, promotion and marketing activities;\n\n                  (5) Market  research  expenditures  related to the development          and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion;          and\n\n                  (6)  Costs  of  organizing   and  providing   facilities   for          international, national, or regional franchisee conferences.\n\n         Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.\n\n         11.C.    SEGREGATION OF ADVERTISING FUND.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  herein   agrees  to   administratively   segregate   the Advertising  Fund on its books and  records.  Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.

SUSPENSION OF ADVERTISING FUND FEES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  reserves  the right to  suspend  contributions/fees  and operations of the  Advertising  Fund for one or more  periods,  and the right to terminate the  Advertising  Fund, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Franchisee.  All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.\n\n         11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.\n\n         In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.\n\n         11.F.    USE OF TRADEMARK REFERENCES AND APPROVAL                   OF FRANCHISEE'S MARKETING.\n\n         Franchisee further agrees that all advertising, promotion and marketing by Franchisee shall be completely clear and factual and not misleading and shall conform to the highest  standards of ethical  marketing and  promotion  policies which may be prescribed from time to time by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee agrees to use the  registration  symbol of \"R\" within a circle (7 ) in connection with its use of the Marks.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials. Franchisee  agrees not to use  promotional or advertising  materials  which have been  disapproved  by Pretzel Time or that have not been approved for use within the preceding twelve months.\n\n         In  addition,  any  pamphlets,  brochures,  cards or other  promotional materials  offering  free Products may only be used if prepared by Pretzel Time, unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance by Pretzel  Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Pretzel Time will give favorable consideration to Franchisee's use of free product cards developed by Franchisee, if the cards clearly state that they may only be  redeemed  at Pretzel  Time Units  owned by  Franchisee.  Franchisee agrees to list and advertise the Franchise in the regular white pages  telephone directories distributed within Franchisee's metropolitan area.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to distribute and display at Franchisee's  location, literature,  display and promotional  materials  including  special  promotional materials  as  Pretzel  Time may from  time to time make  available.  Franchisee agrees that only those advertising,  promotional  materials,  or items which are authorized  by  Pretzel  Time in  writing  prior to use  shall be used,  sold or\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributed,  and no  alternate  display or use of the Pretzel Time Service Mark shall be made without the prior written permission of Pretzel Time.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n         Pretzel Time will make  available to Franchisee  during the term of the Franchise (1) copy of the Operations  Manual by loaning a copy of the Operations Manual to Franchisee. Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that all manuals loaned to Franchisee contain  confidential and proprietary  material and information of Pretzel  Time  provided  to  Franchisee  is to be  used  by  Franchisee  only in connection  with the  operation of the  franchised  Unit and other  Pretzel Time Units. The Operations Manual contains trade secrets and confidential information and will  remain the  property  of Pretzel  Time and shall be  returned to it on termination of this Agreement.  Franchisee  covenants not to reveal the contents of the Operations  Manual to  unauthorized  persons.  Franchisee may not, at any time,  copy the Operations  Manual,  in whole or in part,  either  physically or electronically. In the event Franchisee's copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed or significantly damaged, Franchisee shall be obligated to obtain from Pretzel Time, at Pretzel Time's then applicable  charge,  a replacement  copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         12.C.    INCORPORATION OF OPERATIONS MANUAL INTO AGREEMENT.\n\n         The  Operations  Manual's  specifications,   standards,  and  operating procedures  communicated to Franchisee in writing shall be deemed a part of this Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.  Any  administrative  or financial  Section set forth in the  Operations  Manual shall be in addition to, and not in derogation or limitation  of, any right or remedy  granted to Pretzel Time  under  the  Franchise  Agreement,  the  Operations  Manual,  or any  other document,  or  otherwise  available  to  Pretzel  Time,  at  law  or in  equity, including,  without limitation,  the right to terminate a franchise in the event of certain defaults or delinquencies.\n\n         12.D.    MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n          Franchisee  understands  and agrees  that the  Pretzel  Time System is constantly  being  modified  and  improved,  and  that  such  modifications  and improvements  require  changes  from time to time in the  system of  operations. Franchisee  further  agrees  to  accept  and  comply  with  such  modifications, revisions,  and additions to the Pretzel Time System and Operations Manual which Pretzel Time in the good faith exercise of its judgment believes to be desirable and reasonably necessary in the time period indicated by Pretzel Time.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  Standards  may be  periodically  modified  by Pretzel  Time and that such  modifications  may  obligate  Franchisee  to invest additional capital in the Unit and/or incur higher operating costs. Pretzel Time will not obligate  Franchisee to invest  additional  capital at a time when such investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and specifications  prescribed  from  time  to  time in the  Operations  Manual,  or otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.\n\n13.      UNIT IMAGE AND OPERATION.\n\n         13.A.    CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF UNIT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees that:\n\n                  (1) neither the Unit nor the Site will be used for any purpose          other than the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit in full compliance with          this Agreement or other agreements with Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee  will maintain the condition and appearance of          the Unit, its equipment, furnishings, fixtures, and signs in accordance          with the  specifications  and standards of Pretzel Time and  consistent          with  the  image  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit  as a  first-class,  clean,          sanitary,  attractive and efficiently  operated food service  business;          and\n\n                  (3)  Franchisee  will  perform  such  maintenance  (including,          without limitation,  maintenance  procedures and routines which Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to  time)  with  respect  to  the  decor,\n\n\n\n\n\n         equipment, fixtures,  furnishings,  vehicles, and signs of the Unit and          the Site,  as may be required or directed by Pretzel  Time from time to          time to maintain such condition,  appearance,  and efficient operation,          including, without limitation:\n\n          (a)  continuous  and thorough  cleaning and sanitation of the interior                and exterior of the Unit;\n\n          (b)  thorough repainting and redecorating of the interior and exterior                of the Unit and/or the Site at reasonable intervals;\n\n          (c)  interior and exterior repair of the Unit and/or Site; and\n\n          (d)  repair or replacement of damaged, worn out or obsolete                   furnishings,  equipment,  fixtures  and signs,  provided  that                   Pretzel  Time  will not  require  Franchisee  to  replace  any                   obsolete equipment unless Pretzel Time has initiated a program                   to  replace  such  equipment  as it becomes  necessary  in its                   company-owned Pretzel Time Units; and\n\n                  (4) Franchisee  will not make any material  alterations to the          Site or to the appearance of the Unit as originally developed,  without          prior approval in writing by Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (5) Upon notice from Pretzel  Time,  Franchisee  shall remodel          and conform  Franchisee's  building design, Trade Dress, color schemes,          and  presentation  of Marks to Pretzel Time's then current public image          within a  reasonable  amount of time,  which  shall not  exceed six (6)          months.  Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to          the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as          Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program          promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall          not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or          completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement          shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received          during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by          virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.\n\n         In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:\n\n          (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,                remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or\n\n          (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.\n\n         If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.\n\n         13.B.  UNIT MENU.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.\n\n         13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.\n\n         Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.\n\n         13.D.    EXCEPTION PROCESS.\n\n         If   Franchisee   proposes  to  purchase   materials  or  supplies  not theretofore  approved by Pretzel Time as meeting its  specifications,  or from a supplier or  distributor  not  previously  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time and request  Pretzel  Time's  approval using the special exception form provided to Franchisee in its Operations  Manual, and pay any reasonable fees that Pretzel Time designates therefor.  Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such\n\nmaterials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time.

Franchisee assigns to Pretzel  Time or its designee all of  Franchisee's  right,  title and interest  in and to any and  all  such  Promotional  Allowances  and  authorizes Pretzel  Time or its  designee to collect any such  Promotional  Allowances  for remission to the general operating funds of Pretzel Time.\n\n14.

A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.\n\n         14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.\n\n         14.C.

If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.\n\n         14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n         The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.\n\n         14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.\n\n         Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.\n\n         14.F.    PAYMENT OF TAXES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall be  solely  responsible  for  payment  of all  taxes, including, but not limited to, real estate, sales, payroll,  franchise,  income, personal  property,  and gross  receipts taxes which are assessed as a result of Franchisee's operation of the Franchise.\n\n         14.G.    SALE OF PRODUCT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.\n\n         14.H.    COOPERATION.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.\n\n         14.I.    INSURANCE.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.\n\n         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.\n\n         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.\n\n         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.\n\n         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as \"suggested.\" The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.\n\n15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n\n         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time. Pretzel Time shall provide  Franchisee with forms on which to maintain certain sales and operational  data.  Franchisee  shall furnish to Pretzel Time on said forms that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time:\n\n         (i) On Tuesday of each week,  a report on the Unit's net  revenues  and          sales and operations for the previous week;\n\n         (ii) Every six calendar month period,  a balance sheet and a profit and          loss statement for the Unit for the previous  semi-annual  period and a          year to-date  statement  of  financial  condition as of the end of such          previous period; and\n\n         (iii) Within  thirty (30) days after  Franchisee's  year end, an annual financial report.\n\nThe reports  required in Section 15.A. (ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.\n\n         15.B.   MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees, at all times, he shall keep and maintain  adequate, accurate,  true, and proper records, books, reports, data, and accounts relative to the  franchise  in the English  language  and in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and retain the records for a period of three (3) years  after  the date they  were  prepared,  from  which  there may be  readily determined the  information  required in the operating  reports to be filed with Pretzel Time. Such records include, without limitation, daily cash reports, cash receipts  journal  and general  ledger,  cash  disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks;  tax returns,  supplier  invoices,  dated cash  register  tapes,  weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns.\n\n         Franchisee hereby authorizes  Pretzel Time to utilize the data supplied by  Franchisee  under this  Section  in any  publication,  discovery  statement, Offering  Circular,  or  advertisements  related  to the sale of  Franchises  or related  entities  by Pretzel  Time,  anywhere,  at any time,  without  specific compensation therefor.\n\n16.      AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.\n\n         16.A.    AUDITS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time or its  designee  shall have the right at any time during business  hours and without prior notice to  Franchisee,  to inspect,  audit and copy or the right to cause to be  inspected,  audited and copied,  the  business records,  bookkeeping and accounting  records,  sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchised Business,  including but not limited to,  daily  cash  reports,  cash  receipts  journal  and  general  ledger,  cash disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks; tax returns,  supplier invoices, dated cash register tapes, weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns and the books and records of any  corporation or  partnership  which holds the Franchise  including the personal financial records and tax returns of the Franchisee during and after the term of the Franchise Agreement.  Franchisee agrees to maintain on the premises  all sales and  operational  information  for four weeks.\n\n         Any such  inspection  or audit will take place at a time which will not interfere with  Franchisee's  normal business.  Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.\n\n         In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n         16.B.    RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.\n\n         To determine  whether  Franchisee  and the Unit are complying with this Agreement and with all Pretzel Time's  standards and operations as prescribed by Pretzel Time,  Pretzel Time or its designated agents shall have the right at any reasonable time and without prior notice to Franchisee to:\n\n         a.

Remove  samples of any  Products,  materials or supplies for testing and analysis;\n\n         d.  Interview personnel of the Unit;\n\n         e.  Interview customers of the Unit; and\n\n         f. Inspect and copy any books,  records and  documents  relating to the          operation  of the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with          Pretzel Time in connection with any such inspections, observations,  photographing,  video  taping,  Product  removal and  interviews. Franchisee  shall present to his customers  such comment or evaluation  forms as Pretzel Time periodically  prescribes and shall  participate  and/or request his customers  to  participate  in any surveys  performed by or on behalf of Pretzel Time. At the conclusion of his inspection,  Pretzel Time's field  representative shall prepare a written report which shall contain all of his  observations  and conclusions.  If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.\n\n17.      TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT AND REPURCHASE.\n\n         17.A.  BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         This Agreement is fully transferable by Pretzel Time and shall inure to the benefit of any  assignee,  transferee  or other legal  successor  to Pretzel Time's interest  herein.  If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n         17.B.  BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Franchisee  understands  and  acknowledges  that the  rights and duties created by this Franchise Agreement are personal to Franchisee (or if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  to its  Owners) and that  Pretzel  Time has granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n         17.C.  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER.\n\n         If  Franchisee  is in full  compliance  with this  Agreement  (and,  if Franchisee is a corporation or  partnership,  its Owners are in full  compliance with this Agreement),  Pretzel Time shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of a Transfer that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n         (1) The  transferee  and its  Owners  must  meet  Pretzel  Time's  then          applicable  standards for Pretzel Time Unit  franchisees  and must have          had sufficient business experience,  aptitude,  and financial resources          to operate the Unit;\n\n\n\n\n\n         (2) Franchisee has paid such royalty,  advertising  fund fees,  amounts          owed for purchases by Franchisee  from Pretzel Time and its  Affiliates          and all other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates and third          party  creditors and shall have  submitted to Pretzel Time all required          reports and statements;\n\n         (3)  Franchisee or the  transferee has paid Pretzel Time's then current          transfer fee to defray expenses  Pretzel Time incurs in connection with          the  transfer,  except that if the  proposed  Transfer  is, to or among          Owners of Franchisee, this provision shall not apply;\n\n         (4) The  Transferee  and/or its Unit  Manager  have  agreed to complete          Pretzel  Time's  training  program to Pretzel Time's  satisfaction  and          prior to the date of transfer;\n\n         (5) The  Transferee  has  agreed  to be bound by all of the  terms  and          conditions of this Agreement and executes a current Franchise Agreement          and other franchise documents, a sublease agreement,  if any, and other          documents required by Pretzel Time;\n\n         (6) Franchisee  (and its  transferring  Owners) have executed a general          release,  in form  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time, of any and all claims          against Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their officers,  directors,          employees and agents;\n\n         (7) Pretzel Time has approved the material terms and conditions of such          Transfer,  including,  without limitation,  that the price and terms of          payment are not so burdensome as to affect  adversely the  transferee's          operation of the Unit; provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval          of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel          Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel          Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire          Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit; (8) If Franchisee  (and/or its Owners)          finances  any  part of the  sale  price  of the  transferred  interest,          Franchisee  and/or its Owners have agreed that all  obligations  of the          transferee  under or pursuant to any  promissory  notes,  agreements or          security  interests  reserved by Franchisee or its Owners in the assets          of the Unit or the Premises shall be  subordinate  to the  transferee's          obligations  to pay royalty and service  fees and other  amounts due to          Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  and  otherwise  to comply  with this          Agreement;\n\n         (9) Franchisee (and its Owners) have executed a noncompetition covenant          in favor of Pretzel Time and the transferee agreeing that, for a period          of twelve (12) months commencing on the effective date of the Transfer,          Franchisee,  its  Owners  and  members  of the  immediate  families  of          Franchisee  and each of its Owners will not hold any direct or indirect          interest  as  a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor,  partner,          director,  officer manager,  employee,  consultant,  representative  or          agent, or in any other capacity,  in a Competitive  Business located or          operating  within  three (3) miles of the Unit,  and  within  three (3)          miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit;\n\n         (10) If consent is required, the lessor of the Premises consents to the          assignment or sublease of the Premises to the transferee;\n\n         (11)  Franchisee  has complied with all of its  obligations  to Pretzel          Time, its Affiliates,  suppliers,  and distributors,  and Franchisee is          not in default under this Agreement or any other Agreement with Pretzel          Time or Pretzel Time's Affiliates;\n\n         (12)  All  improvements,  including  refurbishings,   remodelings,  new          equipment must be made prior to the Transfer; and\n\n         (13)  Franchisee  (and its Owners) has agreed that he will not directly          or  indirectly  at any time or in any manner  (except  with  respect to          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Franchisee)  identify  himself          or any  business  as a current or former  Pretzel  Time  Unit,  or as a          franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  use          any Mark, any colorable imitation thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel          Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize  for any purpose          any tradename,  trade or service mark or other  commercial  symbol that          suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or          its Affiliates.\n\n         17.D.    TRANSFER TO A WHOLLY-OWNED CORPORATION.\n\n         Notwithstanding Section 17.B., if Franchisee is in full compliance with this  Agreement,  Franchisee may transfer this Agreement to a corporation  which conducts no business  other than the Pretzel  Time Unit and in which  Franchisee maintains management control and owns and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the equity  and  voting  power of all  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock. Transfers of shares of such  corporation  will be subject to the  provisions  of Section 17.C.(2) and 17.C.(8).

Failure to transfer the interest in this Agreement or such interest in Franchisee within said period of time shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n         17.G.    PRETZEL TIME'S FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.\n\n          If  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall at any time  determine to sell, assign or transfer for consideration  this Agreement or an Ownership Interest in Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide, executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership, copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit and may not  include  an offer to  purchase  any  other  property  or  rights of Franchisee (or its Owners).  However,  if the offeror  proposes to buy any other property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate, contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value for any other property or rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer, provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation, representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock, and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets, validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit. The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).\n\n          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.H.    PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS.\n\n         In the event  Franchisee (or any of its Owners)  shall,  subject to the restrictions  and  conditions  of Transfer  contained in Section 17,  attempt to raise or secure funds by the sale of securities (including,  without limitation, common or preferred stock,  bonds,  debentures or general or limited partnership interests) in Franchisee or any affiliate of Franchisee, Franchisee, recognizing that the written information may reflect upon Pretzel Time, agrees to submit any such written information used with respect thereto prior to its inclusion in any registration  statement,  prospectus or similar offering  circular or memorandum and to obtain Pretzel Time's written consent to the method of financing prior to any offering or sale of such securities. Pretzel Time's written consent pursuant to this Section  shall not imply or  constitute  Pretzel  Time's  approval  with respect to the sale of the  securities,  the  offering  literature  submitted to Pretzel  Time or any other aspect of the  offering.  No  information  respecting Pretzel  Time  shall  be  included  in  any  disclosure   document  unless  such information  has  been  furnished  by  Pretzel  Time  in  writing   pursuant  to Franchisee's  written request,  in which Franchisee states the specific purposes for  which the  information  is to be used.  Should  Pretzel  Time,  in its sole discretion, object to any reference to it or its business or to the relationship of  Franchisee  or  a  controlled  affiliate  in  such  offering  literature  or prospectus,  such  literature or  prospectus  shall not be used unless and until Pretzel Time's objections are withdrawn.  Pretzel Time assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any offering.  Franchisee  shall pay Pretzel  Time's  expenses in connection with the offering or proposed offering.\n\n         The prospectus or other literature  utilized in any such offering shall contain the  following  language in  bold-face  type on the first  textual  page thereof:\n\n         PRETZEL  TIME,  INC. IS NOT  DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  THE ISSUER OF THE          SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO          THIS OFFERING AND/OR THE SUFFICIENCY OR ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION SET          FORTH HEREIN,  INCLUDING ANY  STATEMENTS  WITH RESPECT TO PRETZEL TIME,          INC.  PRETZEL TIME,  INC.  DOES NOT ENDORSE OR MAKE ANY  RECOMMENDATION          WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS OFFERING.\n\n         Franchisee  (and each of its Owners)  agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Pretzel Time, its parent company, subsidiaries, and Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims, demands and  liabilities,  and all costs and expenses  (including,  without  limitation, reasonable  attorneys' fees) incurred in defending against such claims,  demands or  liabilities,  arising  from the  offer or sale of such  securities,  whether asserted  by a  purchaser  of any such  security  or by a  governmental  agency. Pretzel  Time shall have the right (but not the  obligation)  to defend any such claims,  demands or  liabilities  and/or to  participate  in the  defense of any action to which it is named as a party.\n\n18.      TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         18.A.  FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.\n\n         If  Franchisee is in  substantial  compliance  with this  Agreement and Pretzel Time  substantially  breaches a material provision of this Agreement and (1) fails to cure such  breach  within  thirty  (30) days after  written  notice thereof is delivered to Pretzel Time or (2) if such breach cannot  reasonably be cured  within  thirty (30) days after  Pretzel  Time's  receipt of such  notice, undertake  (within  thirty (30) days after Pretzel Time's receipt of such notice and  continue  until  completion),  reasonable  efforts  to  cure  such  breach, Franchisee may terminate this Agreement. Such termination shall be effective ten (10) days after delivery to Pretzel Time of notice that such breach has not been cured and Franchisee  elects to terminate this Agreement.  A termination of this Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by Pretzel Time, and Pretzel Time's failure to cure  such  breach  as  provided  above  shall  be  deemed a  termination  by Franchisee without cause.\n\n19.      DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.\n\n         19.A.  EXACT AND COMPLETE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges that complete  performance of all the terms of this  Agreement  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of  Pretzel  Time  and its franchisees.  It is therefore agreed that complete and exact  performance by the Franchisee  of each of his  promises  contained  herein  is a  condition  to the continuance of this Franchise.\n\n         19.B.    DEFAULT AND RIGHT TO CURE.\n\n         If Franchisee  defaults in the  performance of any of the terms of this Agreement  or the  Operations  Manual,  Pretzel  Time,  in addition to all other remedies  available to it at law or in equity and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies,  may  immediately  terminate  this Agreement by delivering a written notice to Franchisee of any breach of this Agreement and a notice period of  forty-five  (45) days shall be given to  Franchisee,  unless such default is cured by the  Franchisee  within thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Pretzel Time to Franchisee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.\n\n         19.C.  EXTENSION OF NOTICE.\n\n         If any  applicable  law or rule  requires  a  greater  prior  notice of termination,  the prior notice required by such law or rule shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.\n\n         19.D.  REPEATED BREACHES.\n\n         Further,   notwithstanding  anything  herein  elsewhere  contained,  if Franchisee shall repeatedly fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,  or any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which right shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Pretzel Time may be entitled  under this  Agreement or otherwise  under applicable law. As used in this Agreement the term \"repeatedly  fail\" shall mean three (3) defaults within any twelve (12) month period, even if the defaults are later cured.          19.E.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT - 30 DAYS NOTICE - CURABLE DEFAULTS.\n\n         The  occurrence of any one of the following  events shall  constitute a default under this Agreement  requiring a 30 day notice period of termination by Pretzel Time to Franchisee:\n\n                  (i) Franchisee  fails to pay money when due to Pretzel Time as                   required  under the Franchise  Agreement,  including,  without                   limitation,  the franchise  fee, the renewal fee, the transfer                   fee, royalties, and the advertising fund fee;

DISCONTINUANCE OF MARKS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to immediately  discontinue  all use of trade names, trademarks,  logotypes,  forms of advertising  and other  commercial  symbols of Pretzel Time, and forms of advertising indicative of Pretzel Time and cancel all assumed  name  registrations.  Franchisee  further  shall  remove or cause to be removed all signs and  structures  indicative  of a Pretzel  Time Unit and shall alter the premises occupied by Franchisee so as to distinguish the same from its former appearance and from a Pretzel Time franchise.  Further,  Franchisee shall discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.  If Franchisee  refuses to comply  with the terms of this  Section 20 after  Pretzel Time  requests  compliance,  Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right to enter  upon Franchisee's  premises  without being deemed guilty of  trespassing or any other offense,  and make or cause to be made such  changes  at  Franchisee's  expense, which Franchisee agrees to pay upon demand.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to not directly or  indirectly at any time or in any manner (except with respect to other Pretzel Time Units owned by the Franchisee) identify himself or any business as a current or former Pretzel Time Unit, or as a franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee further  agrees to not use any Mark,  any colorable  imitation  thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel  Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize for any purpose any trade name,  trade or service  mark or other  commercial  symbol that suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) agrees after  termination he will not do  business  under any name or in any  manner  that  might tend to give the general  public the  impression  that he is  associated,  affiliated,  licensed, franchised by or related to Pretzel Time.  The Franchisee (or any of its Owners) may not thereafter  use any name,  logo type, or symbol  confusingly  similar to\n\n\n\n\n\nPretzel  Time's  Service  Mark,  logo type or symbol.  If  Franchisee  continues operating a business at the franchised  location it will exert every  reasonable effort to inform the public of his new status,  including a change of  telephone number and advertising materials.\n\n         The Franchise granted to Franchisee  hereunder to sell Products bearing Pretzel Time's Marks does not include the right to sell or advertise for sale of Franchisee's  Franchise itself or of its business location.  No advertisement by Franchisee  or  other  public  solicitation  for  sale of his  interest  in this Agreement  may  include a  representation  of Pretzel  Time's  trademark  or any reference to Pretzel Time or its trademark system.\n\n         20.C.

Franchisee also agrees to return all  materials  and  confidential  information  loaned to  Franchisee, including,  without limitation,  all Operations Manuals and Training Manuals and videos. Franchisee agrees to return all materials and supplies identified by the Marks in full cases or  packages  to Pretzel  Time for credit and dispose of all other materials and supplies, but not equipment,  identified by the Marks within thirty (30) days after the effective  date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n         20.D.    TELEPHONE COMPANY.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.\n\n         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.\n\n         20.F.    LEASING.\n\n         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.\n\n         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.\n\n         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.  The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership  of shares of a class of  securities  listed  on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the  number  of shares  of that  class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding. Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.\n\nThe Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.\n\nNeither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.\n\n         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.\n\n         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:\n\n                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including                   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)                   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period                   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market                   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and                   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete                   or discontinued), or\n\n                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)                   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).                   \"Cash  flow\"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all                   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,                   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual                   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and                   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and                   depreciation.\n\n         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.\n\n         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or\n\n\n\n\n\nits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.\n\n21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.\n\n         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation\n\nany Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:\n\n         (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,          partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent          or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or          operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time          Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of          termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit          operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or\n\n         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding          six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time          Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or          licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written          permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.\n\n         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.\n\n         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\n\n         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n         21.C.    TAXES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.\n\n         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not\n\n\n\n\n\nbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.\n\n         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.\n\n         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.\n\n         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.\n\n22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.\n\n         22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees (\"Confidential Information\"):\n\n         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,          policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and          knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and          franchising of Pretzel Time Units:\n\n         (2) site selection criteria;\n\n         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;\n\n         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,          recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of          the Products;\n\n         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and          knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,          materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;\n\n         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for          Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge          of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;\n\n         (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and\n\n         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial          performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,\n\n\n\n\n\nofficers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:\n\n         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time          System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,          without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee          may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to          disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such          information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement          and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto          as Exhibit H);\n\n         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;\n\n         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential          Information during and after the term of this Agreement;\n\n         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential          Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and\n\n         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or          disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,          restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.\n\n         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.\n\n         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.\n\n23.      ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         23.A.    UNAVOIDABLE DELAYS.\n\n         Delays in the  performance  of any duties  hereunder  which are not the fault of, and not within the reasonable  preventive control of, the party due to perform,  including but not limited to, fire,  flood,  labor  disputes,  natural disasters, acts of God, civil disorders, riots,  insurrections,  work stoppages, slowdowns or disputes,  or other  similar  events,  shall not cause a default in said  performance,  but the parties shall extend the time of  performance  for a period of time equivalent to the length of delay,  or for such other  reasonable period of time as agreed by the parties.\n\n         23.B.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.\n\n         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.\n\n         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's\n\n\n\n\n\nprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject\n\nto continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.\n\n          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.\n\n         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.\n\n         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.\n\n         23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n         Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.\n\n         23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n         Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  \"1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.\n\n         23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.\n\n         Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.\n\n         23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement  executed by both parties hereto.  No oral amendment or waiver will be effective and that this provision cannot be orally amended or waived.  No waiver of default or rights will be effective unless in writing.\n\n         23.J.    HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.\n\n         Subject to the provisions  hereof  relating to transfer and assignment, this Agreement is intended to and does bind the heirs, executors, administrators and successors of any or all of the parties hereto.\n\n         23.K.    CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.\n\n         The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.\n\n         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.\n\n         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.\n\n         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.          23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE\n\n         THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.\n\n         23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\n\n     BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND THE  FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY.  THE PARTIES  FURTHER AGREE THAT NEITHER SHALL DEMAND A JURY TRIAL IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION.\n\n         23.P.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, after December 31, 2018 and during the term of this Agreement, Ferrer may change its Supply Unit Price on any or all the Products from time to time, but no more than once annually, based on documented actual increases to Ferrer's direct manufacturing and labor (but specifically excluding overhead) costs (or those charged by its nominee), provided that Ferrer furnishes the Company with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of any such change. The increase shall apply to any order received by Ferrer after the communication date of the increase. In the event that the new Supply Unit Price for the Products may make the business not feasible, the Parties, in good faith and through the Joint Steering Committee, agree to meet and negotiate in good faith an alternative solution. The purchase price for the Products shall be paid in US Dollars by the Company and such payment terms shall be [***] following the date that the Products are received and accepted (as per Article 4.4 of the LSA) by the Company, by wire transfer into an account designated by Ferrer. Invoices shall be generated upon shipment of Product from Supplier. Invoices should be sent by email to the following address: invoice@cutanea.com. Failure to send invoices to the email address provided herein may cause a delay in approval and payment. In the event that the Company does not fulfill such terms, Parties agree to discuss in good faith alternative payment conditions. In case there is not an agreement between the Parties after 30 days, Ferrer will accept an irrevocable and guaranteed letter of credit payable as term of payment. Additionally, Parties agree to share exchange EUR/ USD rate fluctuations covering the payment of royalties. More concretely, within the first 30 days after every calendar year, Ferrer will calculate the average annual EUR/USD rate based on the EUR/USD rates published in the Financial Times the last business day of every month. Such EUR/USD average rate will be compared with the rate applied in every invoice during the year. If, as a result of this reconciliation, there arises a difference above or under [***]%, Parties agree to share the resulting amount on an equitable basis (50%). Ferrer will report the reconciliation to the Company for its acceptance and, after 15 business days, issue an invoice which will be debited/credited in the next 30 days by wire transfer into the accounts designated by the Parties.

All indemnification claims in respect of any Sanofi Indemnitee or RevMed Indemnitee seeking indemnity under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 (collectively, the \"Indemnitees\" and each an \"Indemnitee\") will be made solely by the corresponding Party (the \"Indemnified Party\"). The Indemnified Party will give the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") prompt written notice (an \"Indemnification Claim Notice\") of any Losses or discovery of fact upon which such Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Section 14.1 or Section 14.2, but failure to provide prompt notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder except to the extent any Losses result from such delay in providing such notice. Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any Indemnitee in connection with the Third Party Claim.\n\n(b) Control of Defense. At its option, the Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within [***] after the Indemnifying Party's receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for the defense of the Third Party Claim. Should the Indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party or any other Indemnitee for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party or other Indemnitee in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim. 72\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any Indemnitee will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnitee's own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense).\n\n(d) Settlement. With respect to any Losses relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnitee's becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnitee in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying Party has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, the Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying Party will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified Party at or prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying Party will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will be at the Indemnified Party's sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying Party that has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnitee that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying Party. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, no Indemnitee will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying Party the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b).\n\n(e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other Indemnitee to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnitees and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation.\n\n(f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the Indemnifying Party's right to contest the Indemnified Party's right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party. 73\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n14.4 Mitigation of Loss. Each Indemnified Party shall take and shall procure that its Affiliates take all such reasonable steps and action as are reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third Party Claims (or potential losses or damages) under this Article XIV. Nothing in this Agreement shall or shall be deemed to relieve any Party of any common law or other duty to mitigate any losses incurred by it.\n\n14.5 Limitation of Liability. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF ANY NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 14.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF ANY PARTY UNDER SECTION 14.1 OR SECTION 14.2, OR DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR A PARTY'S BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CONFIDENTIALITY UNDER ARTICLE XI OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER ARTICLE X.\n\n14.6 Insurance. Each Party shall procure and maintain insurance, including product liability insurance, with respect to its activities hereunder and under the Ancillary Agreements and which is consistent with normal business practices of companies similarly situated at all times during which any SHP2 Inhibitors or Product is being clinically tested in human subjects or commercially distributed or sold. Sanofi may fulfill such obligation through self- insurance. Each Party shall provide the other Party with evidence of such insurance upon request and, in the case of RevMed, shall provide Sanofi with written notice at least [***] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material changes in such insurance. It is understood that such insurance shall not be construed to create a limit of either Party's liability with respect to its indemnification obligations under this Article XIV.\n\nArticle XV.\n\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n15.1 Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be held liable to the other Party nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached this Agreement for failure or delay in performing any obligation under this Agreement to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected Party, including embargoes, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, civil commotions, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances (whether involving the workforce of the nonperforming Party or of any other Person), fire, floods, earthquakes or other acts of God, or acts, generally applicable action or inaction by any governmental authority (but excluding any government action or inaction that is specific to such Party, its Affiliates or Sublicensees, such as revocation or non-renewal of such Party's license to conduct business), or omissions or delays in acting by the other Party, or unavailability of materials related to the Manufacture of the Products (each cause, an event of \"Force Majeure\"). The affected Party shall give notice to the other Party in writing as soon as reasonably practical but no later than [***] after the occurrence of the event of Force Majeure, specifying the nature and extent of the event of Force Majeure, its anticipated duration and any 74\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\naction being taken to avoid or minimize its effect. The suspension of performance allowed hereunder shall be of no greater scope and no longer duration than is reasonably required, and the affected Party shall promptly undertake and continue diligently all reasonable efforts necessary to cure such force majeure circumstances or to perform its obligations in spite of the ongoing circumstances. In the event that RevMed is the non-performing Party and the Force Majeure continues for more than [***] (which period, in its entirety or a portion thereof, is prior to the commencement of the Registration Program for a Product, which Development thereof is impacted by such Force Majeure), Sanofi's payment obligations under Article IX shall be suspended until notification by RevMed to Sanofi of the termination of such Force Majeure Event (and any related triggers and deadlines shall be similarly suspended).\n\n15.2 Assignment; Change of Control.\n\n(a) Neither Party may assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except as expressly permitted hereunder, or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the consent of the other Party, except as follows:\n\n(i) Sanofi may, without consent of RevMed, assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of Sanofi, and RevMed may, with the consent of Sanofi (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), assign this Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in whole or in part to any Affiliate of RevMed; and\n\n(ii) Either Party may, without consent of the other Party, assign this Agreement in whole to (i) in the case of RevMed, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in the case of a Change of Control or (ii) in the case of Sanofi, its successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of its assets to which this Agreement relates, or in connection with a merger, acquisition or similar transaction. In the case of Sanofi the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such successor in interest or assignee or purchaser (such successor in interest or assignee or purchaser, as applicable, an \"Acquiror\") or its Acquiror Family prior to the applicable Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired Party) or thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from [***] and the Acquiror Family shall be excluded from \"Affiliate\" solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth herein. In the case of RevMed, the intellectual property owned or controlled by any such Acquiror or its Acquiror Family prior to the applicable Change of Control or other similar transaction immediately prior to such acquisition (other than as a result of a license from the acquired Party) or is thereafter developed outside the scope of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement shall be excluded from the RevMed Licensed Technology, in each case only for so long as the remainder of the conditions of this Section 15.2 are met, and the Acquiror Family shall be excluded from \"Affiliate\" solely for purposes of the applicable components of the intellectual property definitions set forth herein, in all such cases if and only if: (A) the acquired Party remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror; (B) all intellectual property of the Acquired Party Family and 75\n\nSource: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, 1/17/2020\n\n\n\n\n\nall research and development assets and operations of the Acquired Party Family, in each case relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products, remain with the Acquired Party Family and are not licensed or otherwise transferred to the Acquiror Party Family for any purpose; (C) the scientific and Development activities with respect to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products of the Acquired Party Family and Competing Products of the Acquiror Family (if any) are maintained separate and distinct, and (D) there is no exchange of Know-How relating to SHP2 Inhibitors and Products between the Acquired Party Family and the Acquiror Family. Any attempted assignment not in accordance with this Section 15.2 shall be null and void and of no legal effect. Any permitted assignee shall assume all assigned obligations of its assignor under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respected successors and permitted assigns. For clarity, any assignment by Sanofi shall be subject to Section 9.7(a).\n\n(b) Except as part of a transaction permitted under this Section 15.2, in no event shall RevMed assign or transfer, or agree to assign or transfer to any Third Party, any or all of the RevMed Licensed Patents without the consent of Sanofi, not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned.\n\n15.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future law and if the rights or obligations of either Party under this Agreement will not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (i) such provision shall be fully severable, (ii) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (iii) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance here from and (iv) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible and reasonably acceptable to the Parties. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Party hereby waives any provision of law that would render any provision hereof illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect.\n\n15.4 Notices.

Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature.

Commencing upon selection of a Selected Hit Compound, Anixa (itself and through its Affiliates and designees) will have sole authority over and control of the further development, manufacture, and commercialization of the corresponding Lead Scaffold and any product candidate or product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold. Following the Selection Deadline, Anixa will have no further rights with respect to any Hit Compound that is not a Selected Hit Compound or included within a Lead Scaffold (each, a \"Rejected Hit Compound\"), provided that, during the period of two (2) years following the Selection Deadline, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will use or disclose to any third party any Rejected Hit Compound or any Variant thereof, including the identity, structure or SAR information of any such compound, for application as anti-viral agents or protease inhibitors, for purposes of modulating any Target or for treatment of virus-related conditions. In case OntoChem finds a novel and unexpected antiviral use of those Rejected Hit Compounds during this 2-years period, it will notify Anixa about these findings and Anixa has the right of first negotiation during a period of 6 months after this notification. If Anixa decides to not license those uses or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to develop those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions.\n\n2.5 Subcontractors. OntoChem may engage one or more subcontractors to perform its activities under the Research Plan with the prior written approval of Anixa and provided that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the performance of such subcontractor and (b) enter into a written agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii) prohibiting such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be purchased are nor regarded as subcontractors.\n\n2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, except in the performance of its obligations or exercise of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will discover, research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any compound or product directed to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party (including the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing activities performed on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing includes the screening (including via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target.\n\n2.7 Records. Each Party will maintain complete and accurate records of all activities performed by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all Inventions made or generated by or on behalf of such Party in the performance of the Research Program. Such records will be in sufficient detail and in good scientific manner appropriate for patent and regulatory purposes. Each Party will provide the other Party with the right to inspect such records, and upon request will provide copies of all such records, to the extent reasonably required for the exercise or performance of such other Party's rights or obligations under this Agreement, provided that any information disclosed under this Section 2.7 will be subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5. Each Party will retain such records for at least three (3) years following expiration or termination of this Agreement or such longer period as may be required by applicable law or regulation.\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n2.8 Debarment. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that neither it nor any of its Affiliates or personnel has been debarred under any health care laws or regulations and that, to its knowledge, no investigations, claims or proceedings with respect to debarment are pending or threatened against such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel. Neither Party nor any of its Affiliates will use in any capacity, in connection with the Research Program, any person or entity who has been debarred. Each Party agrees and undertakes to promptly notify the other Party if such Party or any of its Affiliates or personnel becomes debarred or proceedings have been initiated against any of them with respect to debarment, whether such debarment or initiation of proceedings occurs during or after the term of this Agreement.\n\n3. Financial Terms.\n\n3.1 Research Program Payments. In consideration for OntoChem's performance of its activities under the Research Plan, Anixa will:\n\n(a) pay OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows: (i) 16,667 Euros within five (5) days after the Effective Date; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date, except that the last such payment will be due within thirty (30) days after completion of all activities under the Research Plan; and\n\n(b) reimburse OntoChem for its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Research Plan on a pass- through basis without mark-up, within thirty (30) days after delivery of an invoice therefore (including reasonable supporting documentation), provided that Anixa has approved such expenses in advance and in writing (including in regard to the selection of specific Hit Compounds to be synthesized and analyzed in biological assays). It is estimated that OntoChem's out-of-pocket expenses under the Research Plan will include 110,000 Euros payable to Tube Pharmaceuticals GmbH as a subcontractor of OntoChem, subject to Section 2.5.\n\n(c) High-throughput screening compounds\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to acquire these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n(d) Extra custom synthesis\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to have synthesized these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n(e) Biological testing\n\nOntoChem will forward a commercial proposal to have biologically test these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will agree on payment conditions.\n\n3.2 Lead Scaffold Payments. For each Lead Scaffold selected by Anixa, Anixa will pay OntoChem an annual fee of 10,000 U.S. Dollars, payable within thirty (30) days following each anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, until five (5) years after the first commercial sale of the first product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold, subject to Section 4.3 with respect to any Terminated Scaffold (as defined below).\n\n3.3 Milestone Payment. Anixa will pay OntoChem a one-time milestone payment of 300,000 U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days following the dosing of the first patient in the first human clinical trial for the first product incorporating a compound from a Lead Scaffold.\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Payment Terms. Payments to OntoChem will be made by check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as designated in writing by OntoChem from time to time. Taxes (and any penalties and interest thereon) imposed on any payment made by Anixa to OntoChem will be the responsibility of OntoChem. The fees for the respective bank transfers will be borne by Anixa.\n\n3.5 Financial Records. OntoChem will maintain complete and accurate books and accounting records related to all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing the Research Plan. These records will be available for inspection during regular business hours upon reasonable notice by Anixa, or its duly authorized representative, at Anixa's expense, for three (3) years following the end of the calendar year in which such expenses are invoiced. If it is determined that Anixa has overpaid for any expenses passed through by OntoChem under this Agreement, OntoChem will promptly reimburse Anixa for the amount of such overpayment and, if such overpayment represents more than five percent (5%) of the corresponding amount due, OntoChem will pay Anixa's reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with such inspection.\n\n4. Term and Termination.\n\n4.1 Term. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 4.2 or 4.3, this Agreement will be in effect from the Effective Date until completion of the Research Program.\n\n4.2 Termination by Anixa. This Agreement may be terminated by Anixa, without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days written notice to OntoChem.\n\n4.3 Termination of Lead Scaffolds. For each Lead Scaffold, if (a) neither Anixa nor any of its Affiliates, licensees or assignees has dosed the first patient in a human clinical trial for a product incorporating a compound from such Lead Scaffold by the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, or (b) Anixa earlier provides written notice of termination of such Lead Scaffold referencing this Section 4.3, then such Lead Scaffold (each, a \"Terminated Scaffold\") will thereupon cease to be a Lead Scaffold under this Agreement and thereafter, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement: (i) Anixa will promptly assign to OntoChem all right, title and interest in and to any patents and patent applications owned by Anixa that claim such Terminated Scaffold (including the composition, use or manufacture thereof) and, following such assignment, OntoChem will exclusively control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of such patents and patent applications; (ii) the identity, structure and SAR information of such Terminated Scaffold will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of OntoChem; (iii) Anixa will not owe any further annual fees under Section 3.2 for such Terminated Scaffold; and (iv) this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect.\n\n4.4 Termination for Cause. This Agreement may be terminated by either Party for material breach by the other Party, provided that the terminating Party has given the breaching Party written notice of the breach and at least sixty (60) days to cure the breach prior to the effective date of termination.\n\n4.5 Effects of Termination. Promptly following expiration or termination of this Agreement, OntoChem will provide Anixa with an invoice (including reasonable supporting documentation) for any pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses (including non- cancellable commitments) incurred by OntoChem in performing the Research Plan and not yet reimbursed by Anixa, and Anixa will pay such invoice within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. In addition, if this Agreement is terminated prior to completion of the Research Program, OntoChem will promptly furnish to Anixa any Deliverable or other work product generated to date and not previously provided to Anixa, including work in process.\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Survival. Expiration or termination of this Agreement will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties that accrued prior to the effective date of such expiration or termination. The following provisions will remain in effect following expiration or termination of this Agreement and the Parties will continue to be bound thereby: Sections 2.4 (last three sentences), 2.7, 2.8 (last sentence only), 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.5, 4.6, 5, 6, 8 and 9.\n\n5. Confidentiality.\n\n5.1 Definition. \"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed (directly or indirectly) by a Party (in such capacity, \"Discloser\") to the other Party (in such capacity, \"Recipient\") in connection with this Agreement whether in written, graphic, electronic, tangible or any other form. Confidential Information will not, however, include any information that: (a) was publicly known or generally available to the public prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (b) becomes publicly known or generally available to the public after disclosure by Discloser to Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (c) is in the rightful possession of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as shown by Recipient's then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; (d) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of confidentiality and without (to Recipient's knowledge) a breach of such third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser's Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as expressly provided in Section 4.3 with respect to a Terminated Scaffold, the identity, structure and SAR information of: (i) the Hit Compounds will be deemed to be the Confidential Information of both Parties until the Selection Deadline, provided that, during such period, Anixa (itself or through one or more third party service providers on its behalf under a written agreement consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, including with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property) may perform biological assays and other analyses to evaluate the Hit Compounds solely for purposes of selecting Lead Scaffolds pursuant to Section 2.4; (ii) the Lead Scaffolds will be deemed to be Anixa's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice; (iii) the Rejected Hit Compounds will be deemed to be OntoChem's Confidential Information commencing upon the date of the Selection Notice, subject to the last sentence of Section 2.4.\n\n5.2 Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. Neither Party will use any Confidential Information of the other Party for any purpose except as reasonably necessary to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement. Neither Party will disclose any Confidential Information of the other Party nor permit any such Confidential Information to be disclosed, either directly or indirectly, to any third party or its personnel without the other Party's prior written consent, except as expressly permitted hereunder. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information of the other Party to its Representatives who are required to have the information in order for such Party to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement, provided that such Representatives are subject to legally binding non-use and non-disclosure obligations consistent with this Agreement, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such Representatives. If Recipient becomes legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser, Recipient will provide Discloser prompt written notice of such disclosure obligation, if legally permissible, and upon request will reasonably assist Discloser in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If Discloser waives Recipient's compliance with this Agreement or fails to obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed will maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient will take commercially reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of Discloser. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient will take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser in writing of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure, of Discloser's Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes aware.\n\n5.4 Confidential Terms. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation, neither Party will disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that (a) each Party may disclose this Agreement or its terms to its advisors and to existing and potential investors, acquirers, lenders and, in the case of Anixa, licensees on a reasonable need-to-know basis under circumstances that reasonably ensure the confidentiality thereof, and (b) Anixa may issue press releases, make investor and other public presentations and post content on its website from time to time regarding the existence and terms of this Agreement and progress regarding the development, manufacture and commercialization of Lead Scaffolds (including the identity of any permitted subcontractors under this Agreement), to the extent deemed appropriate for purposes of investor relations in its capacity as a publicly traded company and compliance with securities laws and regulations.\n\n5.5 Equitable Relief. Recipient agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Article 5 may cause irreparable injury to Discloser, entitling Discloser to seek to obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal remedies without showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond required to be posted.\n\n5.6 Return of Confidential Information. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon written request, each Party will promptly return to the other Party, or upon written request of such other Party destroy, all materials containing such other Party's Confidential Information, provided, however, that the Recipient may retain in confidence (a) one archival copy of the Confidential Information of the Discloser in its legal files solely to permit the Recipient to determine compliance with this Agreement and (b) any portion of the Confidential Information of the Discloser which the Recipient is required by applicable law or regulation to retain. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the materials described above, the Parties will continue to be subject to the terms of this Section 5.\n\n6. Intellectual Property.\n\n6.1 Background Intellectual Property. All inventions, know-how, data, discoveries and proprietary information, including all intellectual property rights in the foregoing, owned or controlled by a Party as of immediately prior to the Effective Date are and will remain the sole property of such Party.\n\n6.2 Inventions Owned by OntoChem. OntoChem will own, and Anixa hereby assigns to OntoChem, all right, title and interest in and to all Inventions directed to (a) any methods of generating or screening compound libraries and (b) the Rejected Hit Compounds (including the composition, use or manufacture thereof), in the case of this clause (b), effective as of the Selection Deadline (collectively (clauses (a) and (b)), \"OntoChem Inventions\"). As between the Parties, OntoChem will exclusively control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of any patents and patent applications claiming OntoChem Inventions.\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Inventions Owned by Anixa. Anixa will own, and OntoChem hereby assigns to Anixa, all right, title and interest in and to all Inventions other than OntoChem Inventions, including, for clarity, Inventions directed to the Lead Scaffold(s) (including the composition, use or manufacture thereof) (collectively, \"Anixa Inventions\"). As between the Parties, Anixa will exclusively control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of any patents and patent applications claiming Anixa Inventions.\n\n6.4 License Grant. OntoChem hereby grants to Anixa a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, worldwide license (with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses through multiple tiers) under any patents which OntoChem or any of its Affiliates own or control during the term of this Agreement, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import the Lead Scaffold(s) and products that incorporate compounds from the Lead Scaffold(s). OntoChem will not incorporate any invention, discovery or other proprietary information owned by any third party into any Anixa Inventions or Deliverables without Anixa's prior written consent.\n\n6.5 Invention Disclosure and Implementation. Each Party will notify the other Party promptly in writing of each Invention made or generated by such Party. The determination of inventorship with respect to all Inventions will be made in accordance with United States patent law. Each Party will assign, and does hereby assign, to the other Party rights with respect to the applicable Inventions as necessary to achieve ownership as provided in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. Each assigning Party will execute and deliver all documents and instruments reasonably requested by the other Party to evidence or record such assignment or to file for, perfect or enforce the assigned rights. Each assigning Party will make its relevant Representatives (and their assignments and signatures on such documents and instruments) reasonably available to the other Party for assistance in accordance with this Section 6.5 at no charge. However, out of pocket expenses such as travel or communication costs shall be reimbursed. Each Party will have the sole right to file and prosecute patent applications claiming any Inventions of which such Party is the sole owner pursuant to this Agreement without the consent of the other Party, and such other Party will provide, and will cause its Representatives to provide, reasonable cooperation and assistance with such filing and prosecution upon request. To the extent OntoChem is obligated by reason of mandatory provisions of the Gesetz über Arbeitnehmererfindungen (ArbNErfG) (German law covering employee inventions) to make payments to its employees, OntoChem will be solely responsible, and indemnify Anixa, for any and all such payments to OntoChem's employees.\n\n6.6 No Implied Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant to either Party any rights under any intellectual property right of the other Party.\n\n7. Representations and Warranties.\n\n7.1 Mutual Representations and Warranties. Each Party hereby represents and warrants to the other Party that: (a) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is organized; (b) it has the requisite power and authority and the legal right to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; (c) it has taken all requisite action on its part to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations hereunder; (d) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Party and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Party, enforceable against such Party in accordance with its terms; and (e) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by it do not conflict with any agreement, instrument or understanding, oral or written, to which it is a party, or to which it is bound, and it will not enter into any agreement, instrument or understanding, oral or written, that conflicts with the rights and obligations of this Agreement during the term of this Agreement.\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 Additional Representations and Warranties of OntoChem. OntoChem hereby further represents and warrants to Anixa that: (a) to OntoChem's knowledge, OntoChem's performance of its activities under the Research Plan does not infringe or constitute misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of any third party; (b) no licenses, permissions or releases from any third party are necessary for OntoChem's performance of its activities under the Research Plan; (c) OntoChem has obtained rights to use any third-party compound libraries and software referenced in the Research Plan under terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement; and (d) OntoChem's performance of its activities under the Research Plan will not result in any third party acquiring any right, title or interest in or to any Anixa Invention or Deliverable.\n\n7.3 Mutual Covenants. Each Party hereby covenants that: (a) all Representatives of such Party who participate in the performance of the activities contemplated by this Agreement will be subject to written obligations regarding the treatment of Confidential Information and the assignment of Inventions that are consistent with such Party's obligations under this Agreement, as of the commencement of such activities by such Representatives; and (b) such Party will comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection its performance of this Agreement.\n\n8. Indemnification and Insurance.\n\n8.1 Indemnification by Anixa. Anixa will indemnify, defend and hold harmless OntoChem, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any liability, demand, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from (a) Anixa's breach of this Agreement or (b) Anixa's negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, except with respect to any matter for which OntoChem is obligated to provide indemnification under Section 8.2.\n\n8.2 Indemnification by OntoChem. OntoChem will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Anixa, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives from and against any liability, demand, damage, cost or expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from any third-party claim, action or proceeding arising from (a) OntoChem's breach of this Agreement or (b) OntoChem's negligence or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, except with respect to any matter for which Anixa is obligated to provide indemnification under Section 8.1. Financial reimbursements claimed according to such indemnification shall not exceed payments received by OntoChem under this contract.\n\n8.3 Indemnification Procedure. A Party (the \"Indemnitee\") that intends to claim indemnification under this Section 8 will promptly notify the other Party (the \"Indemnitor\") in writing of any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which the Indemnitee intends to claim such indemnification (each a \"Claim\"), and the Indemnitor will have the right to control the defense and/or settlement of such Claim, provided that the Indemnitee will have the right to participate, at its own expense, with counsel of its own choosing in the defense and/or settlement of such Claim. The Indemnitor will not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, enter into any settlement or agree to any disposition of the applicable Claim that imposes any conditions or obligations on the Indemnitee. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable period of time after the commencement of any such Claim will not relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Section 8 except to the extent such failure is prejudicial to the Indemnitor's ability to defend such Claim. The Indemnitee and its Representatives, at the Indemnitor's request and expense, will provide full information and reasonable assistance to the Indemnitor and its legal representatives with respect to the applicable Claim subject to indemnification. It is understood that only a Party may claim indemnification under this Section 8 (on its own behalf or on behalf of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives), and such Party's Affiliates and their respective Representatives may not directly claim indemnification hereunder.\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Insurance. Each Party will maintain liability insurance, with reputable and financially secure insurance carriers, at levels consistent with industry standards based upon such Party's respective activities and indemnification obligations under this Agreement. Upon request, each Party will furnish to the other Party certificates issued by the applicable insurance company(ies) evidencing such insurance.\n\n9. Miscellaneous.\n\n9.1 Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed to place them in the relationship of partners, principal and agent, employer/employee or joint venturer. Neither Party will have the power or right to bind or obligate the other Party, nor will either Party hold itself out as having such authority.\n\n9.2 Use of Name. Neither Party will use the name, logo or trademark of the other Party in any advertising, publicity or other promotional activities without such other Party's prior written consent, unless such use is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations and subject to clause (b) of Section 5.4.\n\n9.3 Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this Agreement by either Party will be in writing (in English) and will be delivered to the applicable Party at its respective address set forth below by personal delivery, e-mail, reputable international courier or registered or certified mail. Notices will be deemed given on the date received if delivered personally, on the next business day if sent by e-mail or international courier, or five (5) days after the date postmarked if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.\n\nIf to OntoChem: OntoChem GmbH Blücherstr. 24, D-06120 Halle (Saale) Germany Attention: Chief Executive Officer E-mail: lutz.weber@ontochem.com\n\nIf to Anixa: Anixa Biosciences, Inc. 3150 Almaden Expressway, Suite 250 San Jose, CA 95118 U.S.A.

This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties hereunder will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws provisions of any jurisdiction. The Parties agree that the 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.\n\n9.5 Arbitration. The Parties agree that any dispute arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement, which cannot be amicably resolved between the Parties, will be finally settled by binding arbitration under the then current rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") by one (1) arbitrator appointed in accordance with ICC rules. Any such arbitration will be conducted in English in the State of Delaware. The arbitrator may grant injunctive or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's decision in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of the arbitration, including administrative and arbitrator's fees, will be shared equally by the Parties. Each Party will bear the cost of its own attorneys' fees and expert witness fees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party may seek a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction from any court of competent jurisdiction in order to prevent immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage on a provisional basis, pending the selection of the arbitrator or pending the arbitrator's determination of the merits of any dispute pursuant to this Section 9.5.\n\n9.6 Severability. If any one or more provisions of this Agreement will be found to be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the Parties will negotiate in good faith a valid and enforceable substitute provision that most nearly reflects the original intent of the Parties, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\n\n9.7 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may be amended or modified, and any of the terms of this Agreement may be waived, only by a written instrument executed by each Party or, in the case of waiver, by the Party or Parties waiving compliance. The delay or failure of either Party at any time or times to require performance of any provision will in no manner affect its rights at a later time to enforce the same. No waiver by either Party of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, will be deemed to be, or considered as, a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of such term or any other term of this Agreement.\n\n9.8 Assignment. Neither Party may assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement (or any of its rights or obligations hereunder) without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that either Party may assign this Agreement without such consent to an entity that acquires all or substantially all of the business or assets of such Party to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise. Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement in violation of this Section 9.8 will be null and void. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n\n9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the complete and entire understanding between the Parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral, regarding such subject matter.\n\n9.10 Counterparts. The Parties may execute this Agreement in multiple counterparts, all of which together will constitute one instrument. Signatures to this Agreement delivered by facsimile or other electronic transmission (e.g., portable document format (PDF)) will be deemed to be binding as original signatures.\n\n(The remainder of this page is intentionally left blank. The signature page follows.)\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\n\n\n\n\nANIXA BIOSCIENCES, INC.

If full  payment  is not  received          within such  specific  period,  the billing Party or CBP may notify the          Managing  Group  of the  status  of the  matter  and  request  that the          Managing  Group  reclaim  the  capacity  in  TAT-14   assigned  to  the          defaulting Party.\n\n21.2     The  Managing  Group shall have the option of  reclaiming  the capacity          assigned  to a Party that is in default  with any  payment  required by          this  Agreement  or is in default  with any other  material  obligation          under this  Agreement,  if such default has existed for a period of six          (6)  months.   The  Managing  Group  shall  consider  any   extenuating          circumstances  not within the specific  control of the defaulting Party          and the  interests of any Party or Parties  that have jointly  assigned          capacity with the  defaulting  Party in  determining  whether or not to          reclaim  the  capacity  assigned  to such  defaulting  Party.  Prior to          reclaiming  the capacity  the  Managing  Group will notify the Party in          writing that it is in default and of the intent to reclaim the capacity          after one (1) month.

The remaining Parties shall          not be  obliged  to make any  payment  to a  defaulting  Party  for the          reclaimed capacity.  Except for the rights and obligations as specified          in Paragraphs 25 and 29 the rights and obligations under this Agreement          of a defaulting  Party shall  terminate at the time the Managing  Group          reclaims all of the capacity previously assigned to a defaulting Party.

CLAUSE THIRD  TERM    3.1 The Contract shall be in force during the period indicated in the Specific Conditions.    3.2 The term of execution of the Service for the Contracted Capacity being the purpose of the Contract hereof may be extended by common  agreement between the Parties by a document subscribed prior to the date of termination of the Contract, subject to the existence of Available  Capacity in the Pipeline during the month of Operation in which the Service is to be provided.    3.3 the obligation of the monthly payment borne by the SENDER for the Service shall be made during the totality of the term of execution of the  Contract.    CLAUSE FOURTH  AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT    4.1 The initial estimated amount of the Contract hereof is as indicated in the Specific Conditions. The final amount of the Contract shall correspond  to the total of the actual invoicing by ECOPETROL and shall be established upon termination and final liquidation of the same.\n\n\n\n  1.2 By virtue of this Contract and as indicated in the Specific Conditions, the SENDER shall have a limited capacity for shipment by the  Pipeline of crudes of its own/production, subject to the existence of Available Capacity during the month of operation of the Service  (hereinafter, the \"Contracted Capacity\").    1.3 The scope of the obligations of ECOPETROL is limited to the reception, custody, shipment, decanting, and indispensable storage for the  transportation and shipment of Crude to the SENDER.    1.4 The Contract hereof does not include the provision of the unloading service in unloading areas, the treatment of crudes, the storage in  export terminals, or any terminal services.

The SENDER shall wave and hold ECOPETROL harmless for any damage or prejudice suffered by ECOPETROL as a result of  failing to receive the Crude in the Exit Point, either by lack of the services before mentioned or by failing to provide the appropriate  facilities for such purpose.\n\n  2\n\n\n\n\n\n   CLAUSE FIFTH  FEES    5.1 The Contract is agreed under the \"Spot\" modality, understanding that the SENDER shall pay for the Barrels effectively transported through the  Pipeline subject to the existence of Available Capacity in the Pipeline during the Month of Operation in which the Service is to be provided.    5.2 The SENDER is obliged irrevocably and unconditionally by subscription of this Contract to the payment of the fee indicated in the Specific  Conditions for each Barrel effectively transported making use of its Contracted Capacity (hereinafter, the \"Fee\").    CLAUSE SIXTH  READJUSTMENTS    6.1 The Monthly Fee agreed in this Contract shall be adjusted each year pursuant to the formula established by the Ministry of Mines and Energy  in Resolution 124 386 of July 15th, 2010 or any provisions the amend, add or supersede it.    CLAUSE SEVENTH  TERMS OF PAYMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n  7.1 The SENDER undertakes the obligation to pay irrevocably and unconditionally the Service for the Contracted Capacity, twenty (20)  calendar days at the latest, after ECOPETROL files in the offices of the SENDER the invoice for the provision of the Service.    7.2 ECOPETROL shall deliver to the SENDER on the twentieth (20) day of each month at the latest a preliminary account (invoice) with the  amount that the SENDER must pay (corresponding to the current month) based on the Nomination made by the SENDER for the current  month.    7.3 Considering that the charging for the Service is made on the Nomination of the current month, ECOPETROL in order to make the  corresponding adjustment to the nominated volume and the volume of Crude actually shipped, shall generate the corresponding debit  and credit vouchers and shall deliver said debit or credit vouchers together with the invoice(s) of the nominated month to be charged.  The due date of the debit and credit vouchers shall be the same as for the invoice (with the nominated volume) of the current month in  order to facilitate the SENDER the making of only one net payment for both items.    7.4 Payments shall be made in Colombian pesos using the arithmetic average of the representative market exchange rate certified by the  Superintendence of Finance or the entity replacing it, of the days of the month corresponding to the Service invoiced.    7.5 The SENDER shall make the payment by means of making a deposit in any of the bank accounts as indicated by ECOPETROL.

With the reception of the information, the Transporter shall analyze the impact of the acquired commitments for Transportation and will  make decisions at its Sole discretion to mitigate the impact.     8.8 Extemporary Nominations     8.8.1 If any Third Party or the Sender fails to meet the terms set out to nominate in accordance with the procedures contained herein, the  Transporter shall not be obliged to accept such nominations. The Transporter shall only accept extemporary nominations as long as the Pipeline  has available Capacity. If the nomination is accepted, the Third Party or Sender shall Pay to the Transporter as a penalty, two (2%) of the  applicable rate to the volumes in barrels delivered in the Pipeline in the respective month.     8.9 Final Report of Operation     8.9.1 At the end of each month of Operation, the Transporter shall prepare a report which shall be delivered to the Senders at the latest on the  tenth (10) working day of the following calendar month of the month of Operation indicating the volumes in Gross Standard Barrels and Net  Standard Barrels delivered and withdrawn and the average qualities at each Point of Entrance and Point of Exit.     CLAUSE 9 BALANCE IN EXCESS OR DEFECT     9.1 The following procedure for the balance of each Sender is established as follows:     9.1.1 Each Sender shall schedule its withdrawals according to its delivery schedules.     9.1.2 In case that a Sender fails to fulfill or is not meeting its delivery schedule during the month of Operation, the Transporter may adjust the  withdrawal schedule of the Sender in question, to comply at all times with numeral 9.1.1 of this clause. In any case, if the Sender fails to meet its  delivery or withdrawal schedule, the Sender shall Pay the Transporter the full amount of costs associated to such breaching, including but without  being limited to those referred to storage or disposal of the Hydrocarbon, which shall be reported through a provisional notice.\n\n\n\n  18\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    9.1.3 In case of withdrawals in excess and in defect it is establish that if a Sender withdraws in excess or fails to withdraw its Hydrocarbon at the  Points of Exit, pursuant to the current schedule, the Transporter may at its Sole judgment start the following procedure:     9.1.3.1 The Transporter shall offer the withdrawal in defect or a portion of it to other Senders in proportion to the assignment of Capacity in the  nomination process in the month of Operation. Each Sender to whom this volume has been offered shall be respond to this offer in the following  forty eight (48) hours.     9.1.3.2 As a result of the responses received, according to the offer of numeral     9.1.3.1, the Transporter may make new offerings or assign the withdrawal in defect.     9.1.3.3 Based on the implementation of the procedure, the Senders who will withdraw the volumes in defect shall be determined.     9.1.3.4 The balance of the withdrawals in excess shall be reflected in the volumetric compensation by quality.     9.1.3.5 In no case the Transporter shall be responsible for the Hydrocarbon that a Sender has not withdrawn and as a result of that, the Pipeline  had to be evacuated. The Sender that has not withdrawn shall have the exclusive responsibility for all damages and costs caused in the  procedures for evacuation that the Transporter has to implement, which shall be informed through provisional notices.     9.1.4 The Transporter shall prepare a monthly balance showing for each Sender, the situation of deliveries and withdrawals in excess or  withdrawals in defect. This balance shall be the result of the process of volumetric compensation for quality (CVC)     CLAUSE 10 PRIORITIES IN THE NOMINATION PROCESS     10.1 For purposes of the nomination process the priorities indicated in this clause shall be followed. In the event in which the sum of the volumes  requested by the Senders exceeds the effective Transportation Capacity, o when due to the events mentioned in numeral 8.7.2 the effective  Transportation Capacity is reduced below the sum of the volumes assigned to the Senders, the Transporter shall calculate the volumes assigned in  the Transportation schedule to each Sender according to the following priorities:\n\n\n\n  19\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    10.1.1 First: Crude of royalties of the State coming from the fields served by the Pipeline. This priority makes reference to a preferred right that  Crude Oils from royalties shall have in the nomination process for the preparation of the Transportation schedules. For purposes of this first  priority, Crude Oil sold by the State to a Third Party or Sender non-owner, shall not be considered as Crude of royalties of the State.     10.1.2 Second: Nominations of the owners, its parent and subsidiaries.     10.1.3 Third: Nominations of Senders non-owners with Ship or Pay Transportation Contracts.     10.1.4 Fourth: Nominations of Third Parties.     10.2 For Transportation Contracts different than Ship or Pay Contracts in force prior to the enforcement of this Manual, a transitory priority  between Third and fourth priority shall be applied.     10.3 Within the Third and fourth priority, the assignment of volumes or the reduction of volumes assigned shall be made at prorate of the  capacities of each Sender and the nomination of each Third Party respectively.     CLAUSE 11 REJECTION OF A TRANSPORTATION REQUEST     11.1 The Transporter reserves the right to reject any Transportation request in addition to the reasons mentioned during the nomination process  and the Transportation schedule, those coming from a Sender who has breached a Transportation contract, this Manual or any applicable  regulations, including but without being limited to:     11.1.1 Delivery of Hydrocarbons without the minimum quality specifications indicated in this Manual.     11.1.2 Failing to deliver sufficient Hydrocarbons to fill in the line in the proportion that corresponds,     11.1.3 Late Payment or no Payment of the rate,     11.1.4 Failing to comply with the Transportation schedule either in deliveries and/or withdrawals.     11.2 The rejection of a request due to any justified event by the Transporter shall not be considered as a breaching of the obligations of the same  and this shall be made without prejudice of other actions the Transporter or the owner may have to make effective the any damages that a Sender  or a Third Party may have caused.\n\n\n\n  20\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    CLAUSE 12 QUALITY REQUIREMENTS     12.1 The minimum values of quality that the Crude delivered by the Senders must have to be accepted for Transportation in the Pipeline are:\n\n   For specific systems the Transporter defines minimum parameters for quality which are listed in Annex 4 Minimum Quality Specifications by  System.     12.2 Quality Certification.     12.2.1 The Sender shall always provide the Transporter a certificate evidencing the characteristics and quality specifications of the Hydrocarbon,  which shall be delivered to the Transporter.

The Identifiable Losses and Non-identifiable losses shall be  distributed among the Senders according to the provisions in the Procedure for Adjustments for Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     13.1.2.2 Increases or reductions necessary to be made as a result of making adjustments for Volumetric Compensation.     13.2 Accounting for losses     13.2.1 The volume of all Crude Oil losses produced in the system shall be calculated by the Transporter using its best Operational and engineering  judgment.     13.3 Process to determine quantities and qualities at the Points of Entrance and Points of Exit.     13.3.1 Quantity measurements and quality sampling of deliveries and withdrawals (including calibration of instruments) shall be the Transporter's  responsibility and shall be made according to the standards and accepted prevailing practices by the API and the ASTM. The installed equipment  to conduct measurements and sampling shall be determined by the Transporter.     13.3.2 The Transporter shall ensure to set out adequate measuring and calibration procedures at the nodes of Entrance and nodes of Exit.  Calibration of the measuring systems shall be made as required by operating circumstances under the Transporter's criteria. The calibration factor  of the meters shall be effective only after the date of the latest calibration except in case of manifest error in which case the last factor of valid  calibration shall be applied.     13.3.3 The Transporter has the responsibility to take two samples of representative Crude Oil according to the API standards and with the  adequate volume for each delivery and withdrawal made. The frequency of such sampling shall be determined occasionally by the Transporter  based on the continuity of the Crude's quality among other factors. Samples shall be used for the following purposes:\n\n\n\n  23\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.3.1 To determine the quality.     13.3.3.2 The Transporter shall retain a sample for each delivery and withdrawal, which shall be used as a counter-sample. The Transporter shall  preserve said sample for a period no longer than 15 calendar days in case there are any claims regarding a specific delivery or withdrawal. After  this lapse of time it will not be possible to make any claims in this sense.     13.3.4 Crude volumes that the Transporter shall be committed to transport shall be determined using the measurement systems of the Pipeline  following the API and ASTM standards. The Transporter shall ensure the filling in of all official forms for each kind of measurement, which shall  contain as a minimum the following information: the date, the readings of the meters or the measures of the storage tank or tanks before starting  and upon completion of the deliveries or withdrawals, the API gravity, densities, temperatures, pressures, sediment and water percentages and any  other necessary characteristic for its identification.

The Sender shall bear the cost of said inspection. For this purpose  the respective Sender shall notify the Transporter the name and title of the independent inspector at least five business days before the  measurement of the corresponding Crude.     13.3.6 The calibration of the measurement equipment shall be made as required by the Operational circumstances or by written request received  from a Sender in particular under the Transporter's judgment. The meters factors shall be updated every time this procedure is conducted. Prior to  the calibration of the meters, the Transporter shall notify the Senders the dates in which said calibration shall be carried out so that they if deemed  necessary, may be present in the calibration. The meters calibration factor shall be effective only after the date of the last calibration and the  parties participating in the calibration shall issue a certificate; otherwise this shall be documented in a letter from the Transporter to the Senders.     13.3.7 Pursuant to API recommendations, testers shall be re-calibrated at least once every five years (from the date of the last calibration) o  immediately after any alteration in the measuring section.\n\n\n\n  24\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    13.3.8 The Hydrocarbon volumes that the Transporter accepts and schedules for its Transportation shall be determined by meters installed in the  nodes of Entrance and/or Exit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transporter may use alternate methods included in the API standards. If the  static measurement of tanks is used, these must have their measurement approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy or the competent entity.  The tank measurement shall be determined following the current existing standards for such purpose.     CLAUSE 14 VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY     14.1 The Regulations of Volumetric Compensation for Quality is an integral part of this Manual as annex 1 (MECHANISMS OF COMPENSATION  OF QUALITY FOR THE MIX OF CRUDE OILS).     14.2 Each of the Senders shall deliver to the Transporter at a Point of Entrance a Hydrocarbon volume which, and only for purposes of Volumetric  Compensation for Quality (CVC), shall be valued according to the procedure defined for the Pipeline and in accordance with its particular quality.  This quality shall be determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the  Sender.     14.3 Considering that as a result of the Transportation the Hydrocarbons delivered in the Pipeline are mixed without distinction, each Sender shall  withdraw at the Point of Exit a volume of Hydrocarbons with a different quality than its Hydrocarbon delivered, except when it has been requested  and has been accepted the Transportation of Hydrocarbons in a segregated manner. The quality of this segregated Hydrocarbon shall also be  determined by an independent quantity and quality inspector accepted and recognized both by the Transporter and the Senders. This  Hydrocarbon shall be assessed only for purposes of Volumetric Compensation for Quality and shall take into account the compensation for  quality due to the interfaces occurring when transported with other Crude Oils.     14.4 The Transporter shall apply the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality defined by the same for the Pipeline which shall have the  following main characteristics:     14.4.1 The Senders who have delivered to the Transporter Hydrocarbons with a better quality than the mixed Hydrocarbon withdrawn at the Point  of Exit of the Pipeline shall be entitled to compensation in volume, equivalent to the volumes that Senders who have delivered Hydrocarbons of  lower quality than the ones withdrawn at the Point of Exit will have to assume. For such purpose, individual qualities of all volumes delivered and  withdrawn shall be taken into account as well as the final inventories of the preceding month of Operation and the last month of Operation, with its  respective qualities.\n\n\n\n  25\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    14.4.2 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be internal between the Senders in such a way that the final volumetric balances equal cero  and the Transporter shall neither charge nor Pay any volume for this purpose and shall only serve as a mediator, regulator, liquidator and  responsible for the volumetric distribution of the compensations.     14.4.3 The Volumetric Compensation for Quality is not part of the Rate and therefore shall not be compensated or will have any variation as a result  of this.     14.5 In each month of Operation the Transporter shall make a balance of the existing volumes and qualities at the beginning of the month delivered  to the Pipeline, lost, withdrawn and existing at the end of the month, both for the total of Hydrocarbons as well as for individual Hydrocarbons of  each Sender.     14.6 The Sender shall hold the Transporter and owner harmless against any cost, action, claim, intended procedures by any Third parties, losses  and all damage and obligations incurred and inherent to the mix of Hydrocarbons in the Transportation process and the Volumetric Compensation  for Quality.     14.7 In any case the Transporter may modify the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality contained herein, in the respective annexes  and all other documents in connection with the CVC.     14.8 Senders of a specific Hydrocarbon may agree with the Transporter not to apply the Volumetric Compensation for Quality to said  Hydrocarbon. The foregoing shall be applicable as long as the Hydrocarbon of other Senders is not affected negatively.     14.9 By agreement between the totality of Senders and the Transporter, it may be decided not to implement the Volumetric Compensation for  Quality (CVC) for Crude Oils transported through the system. In this case the Transporter may implement any other mechanism validated with the  Senders to carry out the volumetric balances.     CLAUSE 15 BULLETIN OF TRANSORTATION BY THE PIPELINE - BTO     15.1 The Transporter shall implement the Bulletin of Transportation by the Pipeline - BTO - which shall contain as a minimum the following  information:     15.2 Information of public access:     15.2.1 General description of the Pipeline     15.2.2 Current rates for each Distance     15.2.3 Value tables or current calculation formulas of Monetary Conditions     15.2.4 Design Capacity of the Pipeline and Nominal Capacity\n\n\n\n  26\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    15.2.5 Monthly available Capacity of the Pipeline estimated for the next (6) months and annual for the next five (5) years.     15.2.6 Excerpts of this Manual corresponding to connection requests, nomination process and minimum quality requirements of Crude Oil     15.3 Information of exclusive access for Senders and Third parties:     15.3.1 This valid Manual.     15.3.2 Discussion on modifications to the Manual     15.3.3 General information on the programmed maintenance schedule of the Pipeline and other programed activities affecting the effective Capacity  during the next six (6) months.     15.3.4 Listing of expansion projects and changes in the Pipeline's infrastructure     15.3.5 Effective Capacity confirmed for each month of Operation and estimated for the following five (5) months and the corresponding available  Capacity for each Distance.     15.3.6 Transportation program for the month of Operation and tentative for the following (5) months for each Distance     15.3.7 Description of the mechanism established by the Transporter and foreseen in the nomination process to assign the available Capacity  equitably     15.3.8 Last volumetric balance prepared for the Pipeline.     15.3.9 Daily statistics for the last month of Operation and monthly statistics since the enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the Ministry  of Mines and Energy on the information on Effective Capacity and Volumetric Balances.     15.3.10 The annual rates and the Monetary Conditions for each Distance from the date of enforcement of Resolution 181258 of 2010 from the  Ministry of Mines and Energy.     15.4 The Transporter is no obliged to publish any information of reserved character.     15.5 The Transporter shall provide to Senders and any Third parties interested in transporting Hydrocarbons through the Pipeline as requested,  within the following ten (10) calendar days after the request and with previous verification from the Transporter of their Capacity as Sender or  Third Party an access password to the information of exclusive character referred to in numeral 15.3 of this clause.

The Sender shall Pay the Transporter all costs incurred in the  analysis and eventual treatment of this Hydrocarbon to place it within the required specifications or to implement the scheme required for its  Transportation.     16.1.6 The Transporter shall be entitled, with a previous provisional notice, to remove and sell the Crude of any Sender that fails to comply with  any of the specifications at its Sole discretion. If the Transporter exercises its right of sale pursuant to this clause, the Transporter shall deduct  from the proceeds of such sale all costs incurred by the Transporter with respect to the storage, removal and sale of such Crude Oil. The  Transporter shall pay the balance to the Sender.\n\n\n\n  28\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    16.1.7 The Transporter shall not accept Crude Oil delivered by any Sender if this may cause impairment to the Pipeline of the Crudes or mixtures  transported (without consideration of whether or not the Crude Oil meets the minimum quality specifications).     16.1.8 The Transporter acting reasonably and in good faith, shall be entitled to make any changes to the minimum quality specifications of Crude  Oil in accordance with operating practices, which may be necessary or pertinent, including but without being limited to, prevent material damage or  the material degradation of the effective Capacity of the Pipeline in order to prevent any personal injuries or damage to the property or the  environment.     CLAUSE 17 REGULATIONS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF SEGREGATED HYDROCARBON     17.1 With a previous request from the Sender or Third Party, the Transporter may accept the Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon to the  extent that this is a technical and economically viable alternative. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon cannot change the scheme set  out in clause 10 and shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions in this Manual.     17.2 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Transporter shall inform the Sender its disposition to start the Transportation of segregated  Hydrocarbon. The Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be subject to the nomination process set forth in this Manual.     17.3 Any additional charges for Transportation of segregated Hydrocarbon shall be borne by the Sender or Third Party requesting the service, and  it will be taken into account, including but without being limited, any costs and damage caused to the Transporter, owner or other Senders.

The Transporter shall prepare the information corresponding to the volume of  Hydrocarbon affected and the proportion corresponding to each Sender.     18.4 The Transporter shall be responsible for the Transportation service, for any losses, damage or deterioration that the Hydrocarbon may suffer.  The Transporter shall be released from any responsibility in the Justified Events and the Transporter is not incurring in any gross negligence.     18.5 Any damage or prejudice caused to the Transporter by virtue of failing to comply with the regulations contained in this Manual by any  Sender shall be the responsibility of the Sender who shall indemnify the Transporter for such damage or prejudice.     18.6 Hydrocarbons delivered by each Sender and transported through the Pipeline may vary in their quality as a result of the mix with other  Hydrocarbons. Except for events in which segregated Hydrocarbons are transported, the Transporter shall not have any obligation to return at the  Point of Exit a Hydrocarbon of the same quality as the Hydrocarbon delivered for its Transportation at the Point of Entrance. The adjustments of  Volumetric Compensation for Quality shall be applied to the transported mixed Hydrocarbons.     18.7 In the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline, contamination fronts are generated. All Senders  of the Pipeline shall accept as withdrawn volume, a portion of the contamination fronts generated in the Transportation through the Pipeline. If the  Sender requires some special conditions for the Transportation of a Hydrocarbon, these shall be agreed with the Transporter who reserves the  right to accept them and require the Sender to bear all costs associated to such conditions.     18.8 The following shall be considered in the Transportation of Hydrocarbon mix and Hydrocarbon segregated through the Pipeline:     18.8.1 The Hydrocarbon of higher quality with respect to the Hydrocarbon of lower quality shall always be degraded in the contamination fronts.\n\n\n\n  30\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    18.8.2 The Transporter shall estimate a maximum volume corresponding to the contamination fronts and shall be responsible to comply with this  value.     18.9 The Transporter is obliged to return the Sender and the latter to withdraw at a Point of Exit, the volume of equivalent Hydrocarbon upon  application of the mechanism of Volumetric Compensation for Quality.     18.10 The Senders and Third parties shall indemnify and hold the Transporter and the owner harmless against any costs, claims, litigations, judicial  or extra-judicial action, and decisions of any kind, which may be brought against the Transporter or owner, and in general by any procedure  intended by any Third parties.

CLAUSE 30 APPLICABLE LEGISLATION     30.1 This Manual is governed in all its parts by the applicable regulations of the Republic of Colombia.\n\n\n\n  39\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   ANNEX 1: MECHANISMS OF QUALITY COMPENSATION FOR THE MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL     ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURES OR VOLUMETRIC BALANCES     The Transporter shall conduct the volumetric balance with a monthly frequency in order to establish the volumes injected by each Sender to the  Pipeline, the identifiable losses, the Non-identifiable losses, consumptions, inventory variations, and any adjustments for quality if the latter is  applicable.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions set out in the Manual of the Transporter for handling Losses in the Pipeline and in the annex  hereof shall be applied.\n\n   The Transporter assumes the totality of costs for consumption of Crude Oil.\n\n\n\n   In order to make equitable adjustments between the Senders of the Pipeline by the differences in value resulting for differences in  quality of Crude Oils delivered I the Pipeline, a procedure of volumetric compensation for quality shall be established (\"CVC\"  in  Spanish).     The purpose of the CVC is to establish a system to compensate Senders for the degradation or improvement of the Crude Oil withdrawn  compared with the Crude delivered. The Sender withdrawing a Crude o lower quality than the Crude delivered shall be compensated  with a higher volume. The Sender withdrawing a Crude with higher quality than the Crude delivered shall compensate others Senders of  better quality accepting a lower volume. At any rate, the sum of debits and credits by CVC for all Senders shall be cero.\n\n\n\n  1. LOSSES\n\n  2. CRUDE OIL CONSUMPTION\n\n  3. VOLUMETRIC COMPENSATION FOR QUALITY - CVC\n\n  3.1 When Crude Oils are delivered to the Pipeline of different quality and from different Senders, the result shall be a Crude Oil with  different characteristics of quality and market value than the Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline by each of the Senders. Due to different  qualities of Crude Oil delivered to the Pipeline, some Senders shall withdraw Crude of higher value than the Oil delivered while others  shall withdraw Crude Oil with less value than the Oil delivered to the Pipeline.\n\n  40\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    At any node of Entrance of the Pipeline where two or more Crude Oil flows merge in order to be transported, a volumetric compensation  for quality shall be established on the resulting mix.\n\n   For purposes of the procedure hereof, the provisions in the Manual of the Transporter shall be applied for measurements in the  Pipeline.\n\n   The Transporter set out detailed procedures for the CVC following the guidelines established hereto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   For any month of Operation the corresponding quantity of Crude of each Sender shall be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  3.2 SAMPLING AND SYSTEM MEASUREMENT\n\n  3.3 CVC PROCEDURES\n\n  3.3.1 The Transporter shall administer the CVC process and the Senders may audit the process or request reviews thereto as long as the  Transporter is timely informed and a working plan is coordinated between the parties.\n\n  3.3.2 The Transporter shall establish monthly the coefficients for adjustments of quality and sulfur pursuant to the criteria established  herein.\n\n  3.3.3 The CVC shall be settled in kind.\n\n  3.3.4 The Transporter shall make monthly adjustments to the corresponding volume of Crude to each Sender, based on the coefficients of  adjustment for quality.\n\n  (a) Reduced if such Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of lower quality than the average quality of the mix,\n\n  (b) Increased if said Sender of the Pipeline delivers Crude of ah higher quality than the average quality of the mix.\n\n  3.3.5 At the latest on the 15th day of the calendar month following the Operation, Senders shall report to the Transporter the export prices,  the API gravity and the sulfur content of its Crude for the Month of Operation.\n\n  41\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The parties may jointly review:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   The API gravity and the sulfur content on the data base of the Crude quality are representative of the current qualities of Crude  which is being delivered.     The variability of the API gravity and sulfur is within an allowed tolerance to be determined by the parties. Analyses of sulfur  content shall be conducted based on a schedule agreed by the parties after the beginning of the Fiscal Year.\n\n   By means of using the Crude Oil basket of reference the variation of price shall be determined regarding the API grade and sulfur content for Crude  Oil delivered. The method is based on the use of the linear regression of prices of a Crude Oil basket of reference delivered in the coast of the Gulf  of The United States of America with API gravity and sulfur content.\n\n\n\n  3.3.6 Each month of Operation the Transporter shall measure the volumes delivered by the Senders and shall determine the weighted  average for the quality parameters of Crude Oils delivered.\n\n  3.3.7 The Transporter shall calculate the adjustments to the volume for each Sender and shall determine the Crude volume that  corresponds. No adjustment in the volume as a consequence of the CVC shall affect the Transportation fee that a Sender shall Pay to  the Transporter.\n\n  3.3.8 Senders acknowledge that adjustments to their Crude volumes to be withdrawn as a result of these principles and procedures of the  CVC may affect the volume of Crude Oil for a withdrawal afterwards.\n\n  3.3.9 Senders are entitled to review the Transporter's calculations regarding the adjustments by CVC and the due application of this  procedure.\n\n  (a) The appropriateness of the Crude Oil reference basket regarding their terms of quality.\n\n  (b) The information on prices available to the public.\n\n  (c) The calculations of the coefficients and the volumes adjusted.\n\n  3.3.10 A data base for the API gravity shall be developed and sulfur content for Crude delivered from reliable samples of laboratory of  Crude Oil flows. The quality data of Crude Oil must comply with the following criteria:\n\n  3.4 METHODOLOGY FOR CRUDE OIL VALUATION\n\n  42\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1\n\n   The basket of Crude Oil to be used shall always include a minimum of ten (10) Crude Oils. The basket of reference for Crude Oil with prices and  qualities historically recognized shall be used to determine the coefficients of adjustment for API grade and sulfur content. The price information  of the basket shall be continuously available from sources open to the public for each Crude Oil of reference. Prices reported used in the basket of  Crude Oil of reference shall be obtained from independent price information services recognized by the industry and shall come from real  Operations.     This basket provides a range of qualities to develop the coefficients for the regressions and therefore cover the flows that may be injected to the  Pipeline. The initial basket of Crude Oils to be used is the one established in table I of this procedure which may be reviewed by common  agreement between the Transporter and the Senders.\n\n   All price quotes of Crude Oil for a common location in the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America shall be adjusted.     All prices of Crude Oil of reference shall be adjusted with respect to the location and based on the availability of price information according to the  following list:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Tables II to IV of this procedure show examples for calculation of basket Crude prices delivered in the Gulf Coast.\n\n   To determine API gravity and sulfur coefficients linear regressions shall be run using the minimum square method.\n\n\n\n  3.4.1 BASKET OF REFERENCE FOR CRUDE OIL\n\n  3.4.2 CALCULATION OF CRUDE OIL PRICES FOR THE BASKET IN THE COAST OF THE GULF\n\n  1. FOB quotation\n\n  - Transportation to the Coast of the Gulf of The United States of America is added using the appropriate vessel size.\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  2. CIF quotation\n\n  - Customs Tariffs, Oil pollution Liability Insurance, \"Superfund\" taxes are included and others as appropriate.\n\n  3. Crude Oil delivered by the Pipeline\n\n  - Any Pipeline fee is added if necessary\n\n  - \"Superfund\" is included and other fees/tariffs as appropriate.\n\n  3.4.3 LINEAR REGRESSION FOR PRICES, GRAVITY AND SULFUR\n\n  43\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    First the arithmetic average is calculated for prices of the basket of Crude Oils of reference delivered in the Gulf coast for three months. The  cumulative average for three months shall be calculated at the closing of the settling month using the prices for the settling month and the two (2)  previous months prior to the settling month (See 1 in table V).     To determine the API gravity coefficient, a linear regression analysis shall be performed using the three months average of Crude prices from the  basket calculated in the paragraph above as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 2 in table V).     To determine the sulfur content a linear regression analysis shall be conducted using the three month average of Crude prices from the basket  calculated in the previous paragraph as the dependent variable. Likewise, the API gravity and sulfur content is used for each Crude Oil of  reference as the independent variables. The formula to be used makes a regression of the price as a function of API gravity and sulfur  simultaneously (See 3 in table V).     The results of the determination of the linear relation between the price delivered and the API gravity and sulfur content may be stated in the  following lineal equation:     Y = A1* X1+ B* X2 + b     Pr = A1* APIR+ B*SR + b (1)     Where:     PR = Crude price in $/Bbl     A1 = API gravity coefficient determined through linear regression in $ by grade API-Bbl     APIR = Independent variable of API gravity     B = Sulfur coefficient determined through linear regression in $/%S-Bbl (negative number)     SR = Independent variable of sulfur content     b = Y interception determined from the linear regression in $/Bbl.\n\n   After obtaining the API and sulfur coefficients, a volumetric adjustment shall be calculated to conciliate differences between the quality of each  Sender and the mix transported. The quantity to be adjusted for each Sender is determined as is follows:\n\n\n\n  3.4.3 ADJSUTMENT OF VOLUMES FOR SENDERS (TABLE VI)\n\n  44\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    The relative value of Crude Oil for each Sender shall be calculated at the Point of Entrance. To obtain this, the API gravity of Crude from each  Sender is multiplied by the API coefficient obtained in the regression and then adding to this result, the multiplication of the sulfur percentage of  Crude from each Sender by the sulfur coefficient obtained in the regression. See table VI in the column - Relative value of Crude $/BBL     The relative value of the mix transported is calculated with the data of the relative value of each Crude Oil from all Senders. This value is obtained  calculating the weighted average of the relative values of each Crude Oil multiplied by the volume delivered by the Sender. (See (1) table VI     After this, the average export price of the mix must be obtained with the data from exports of all Senders in the month in which the adjustments are  made. (See (2) in table VI     To obtain the calculated price, the difference between the relative value of each Crude Oil and the relative value calculated for mix (1) must be  obtained, and add this difference to the average export price of the mix.     Then, the quantity delivered by the Sender is multiplied by its calculated price and this product is divided between the average export price of the  mix, obtaining as a result the total adjusted volume by Sender.     The volume to be adjusted shall be the difference between the total adjusted volume by Sender and the volume delivered by a Sender to the  Pipeline.     The sum of volumes to be adjusted from all Senders must be cero.     The Transporter shall run the linear regression using a spreadsheet such as Excel. The Transporter shall document the statistical results of the  linear regression so that the information can be provided to any Sender upon request.\n\n\n\n  45\n\n\n\n\n\n  Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1   Table I     Reference Crude Basket\n\n   Table II     Illegible Information     Table III     Illegible Information     Table IV     Illegible Information\n\n\n\nDegree Origin API, ° Sulfur% Source for   Pricing  BBL/MT\n\nArab Light Saudi Arabia 33.2 1.9 Argus, Formula 7.34  Arab Medium Saudi Arabia 30.5 2.4 Argus, Formula 7.22  Arab Heavy Saudi Arabia 27.6 2.8 Argus, Formula 7.09  Castilla Colombia 18.8 2.0 Platts 6.70  LLS US Gulf Coast 36.2 0.3 Argus 7.47  Mars US Gulf Coast 28.0 2.1 Argus 7.15  Maya Mexico 21.1 3.5 Argus 6.80  Napo Ecuador 18.0 2.3 Platts 6.66  East Ecuador 24.0 1.2 Platts 6.93  Vasconia Colombia 26.5 0.9 Platts 7.04\n\n  46\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    Table V     Linear regression of prices, API gravity and sulfur - August 2010 Closing Example\n\n\n\n   Table VI     Adjustments of volumes for senders - August 2010 example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  API Sulfur JUN-2010 JUL-2010 AUG-2010 Average of   3 previous   months (1)  Arab Light 33.2 1.9 77.60 76.26 76.29 76.72  Arab Medium 30.5 2.4 75.84 74.59 74.62 75.02  Arab Heavy 27.6 2.8 74.34 73.32 73.25 73.64  Castilla 18.8 2.0 69.84 69.20 69.20 69.41  LLS 36.2 0.3 78.94 78.84 79.79 79.19  Mars 28.9 2.1 74.63 74.18 74.35 74.39  Maya 21.1 3.5 66.27 67.47 68.65 67.46  Napo 18.0 2.3 69.56 69.02 69.08 69.22  East 24.0 1.2 72.12 71.93 72.15 72.07  Vasconia 26.5 0.9 74.93 75.89 75.29 75.37\n\n(2) API, $/API-BBL Coefficient 0,495      (3) Sulfur, $%S-BBL (1,191)\n\nBank of Quality Coefficients       API Coefficient (0.50)  Sulfur Coefficient (1.19)\n\nSender Volume   injected   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nAPI in   the   injection   point\n\nSulfur in   the   injection   point\n\nRelative  value of   the crude   S$/BBL\n\nCalculated   Price   $/BBL\n\nTotal   Volume   adjusted   by sender   MBBL/mo\n\nVolume   to adjust   MBBL/mo\n\nSender A 900 31 0.5 14.75 77.97 935 36  Sender B 1,200 26 1.0 11.69 74.90 1,195 (2)  Sender C 600 20 2.0 7.53 70.74 566 (34)  Total 2,700         2,700 -\n\n(1) Relative value calculated for mix 11.79  (2) Average price of exportation of mix, August 2012 75.00\n\n  47\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 2: DEFINITION OF STANDARD BARRELS PER SYSTEM\n\n\n\n\n\n  48\n\n\n\n\n\n   Operation and Transport Regulations Version 1    ANNEX 3: DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMS     See File Annex 3 attached.

Regarding the guarantees in  the proceedings to prevent bankruptcy, creditors still governed under Law 550/1999 (that is, territorial entities, decentralized entities and state  universities at the national or territorial level) have the power to inform the promoter within the following ten (10) days after starting the  negotiation, if the decision is only to make the guarantee effective without waving their right to obtain from the debtor the payment of the  obligation under default pursuant to the paragraph of article 14 of said Law. In those cases, ECOPETROL through the vice presidency of corporate  finance and the respective manager and/or director shall inform the Promoter if the guarantee will be made effective. Furthermore, Law 1116 of 2006  did not include the provision of the foregoing paragraph, instead, in article 43 the Law regulated the issue of real estate guarantees within the  process of insolvency, and therefore the power to make them effective was suspended, save by authorization of all creditors to wave said  limitation. Said decision shall be made with an absolute majority and included within the Agreement. Thus, the creditor may present in the  proceedings, together with its debt, the guarantee covering it and a request to make it effective, or else wait the development of the proceeding,  and if terminated by breaching, the enforceability will be then \"reactivated\".\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.12 Restructuring by General Agreements.\n\n  18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Provision of services to clients with whom global payment agreements have been executed or under Law 550/99 or Law 1116/06 shall only be made  under the modality of payment in advance. Interests in favor of ECOPETROL derived from individual refinancing processes or restructurings  cannot be cancelled. Presently there are no regulations that allow the cancellation of interests by public entities such as ECOPETROL.     All refinancing shall be subject to approval by the respective manager and/or director with previous approval from the vice presidency of  corporate finance and after a commercial, financial and legal analysis; and evidence of economic support.\n\n   The calculation for the provision shall correspond to a technical evaluation (individual study based on the factors previously described) that will  allow to determine the contingency of loss or risk for non-collecting the right. Based on this the recording of an individual provision shall be made.     Accounting Provision: The Coordination of Receivables and collections together with the officers responsible for the management the Business  Units providing this service shall conduct an individual analysis of Receivables in default to determine which accounts are considered un- collectible, and based on that, make the recording of an individual provision. To do this, the manager and/or director of the Business Unit of  providing the service must submit a memorandum requesting the recording of the corresponding provision.     Fiscal Provision: For purposes of this provision, Receivables are classified by seniority and are calculated according to the percentages set out by  tax regulations. Any of the two methods indicated hereunder may be applied as a deduction for the provision:\n\n\n\n10 Defined according to the contingency of loss of the rights to be collected as a result of the degree of seniority, default, prescription, and  collection action through legal means; the provision includes the amount estimated as uncollectable.\n\n\n\nECOPETROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVABLES SERVICES ECP-UTE-G-008\n\n3.13 Provision for Accounts Receivable10\n\n  · Individual: four debts between 12 and 24 months (33%), between 24 and 36 months (66%) and over 36 months (99%).    · General: the corresponding percentages are applied depending on the seniority of their Receivables.

(c) Notice of Claim. In the event that an HOF Entity seeks indemnification on behalf of an HOF Entity Indemnified Person, or Constellation seeks indemnification on behalf of a Constellation Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the \"Indemnified Party\") shall give reasonably prompt notice to the indemnifying Party (the \"Indemnifying Party\") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, any Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. Subject to the terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of any valid claim not more than ten (10) days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such amount.\n\n11\n\nSource: GPAQ ACQUISITION HOLDINGS, INC., S-4/A, 1/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Right to Contest Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation Indemnified Person or HOF Entity Indemnified Person) (a \"Third Person\"), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a \"Third Person Claim\"), provided that the Indemnifying Party has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying Party, on such terms as the Indemnified Party may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

In the event that, after the construction and development of the Village has been substantially completed, the Village is not usable for a period of at least thirty (30) days as a result of the events described under this Section 6.7 and unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Term shall be extended for that period of time (after substantial completion) which the Village was not usable and the start and end dates of each period shall be adjusted to reflect the number of days (after substantial completion) in which the Village was not usable for all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation the expiration date of the Term. 6.8 Not a Lease or License of the Village. This Agreement will not constitute a lease or license of any part of the Village.

In the event that either Party or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other Party with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other Party either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 Press Releases. The HOF Entities and Constellation shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or scheduling any press conference or conference call with media members or other third parties with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

The headings used in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the provisions set forth herein. 6.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, and on separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 6.16 Waiver. No action, other than a notice by a Party to another Party specifically stating that such notice has the effect of waiver, shall constitute a waiver of any particular breach or default of such other Party.

No waiver of full performance by a Party shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third Party Beneficiaries.

New marketing advantages based upon competitive pricing, cross marketing and new revenue streams from expansion into other industries will grow the business beyond anything previously imagined. The structure may also be used for additional compatible acquisitions which will also fuel growth. TKCI believes that structuring operations with Tribal Sovereignty will deliver the financial advantages of operating in a tax free environment with limited liability, plus other benefits such as permit and zoning ease, supporting an ideal structure for investment capital and successful entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nTerm\n\nThe term of this Agreement is twenty-four (24) months. The Agreement may be renewed, subject to mutual written approval.\n\nNotwithstanding the completion, expiration or termination of this Agreement, the indemnities warranties and undertakings contained or referred to in this Agreement shall continue to subsist for as long as may be necessary for the purpose of giving effect to each one and every one of them.\n\nTKCI Committments\n\nTKCI shall establish a wholly-owned subsidiary (the \"Holding Company\") for the sole purpose of conducting and developing business on behalf of this alliance.

(\"FIIOC\") and NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION (\"Company\").\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC provides transfer agency and other services to Fidelity's Variable Insurance Products Fund, Variable Insurance Products Fund II and Variable Insurance Products Fund III (collectively \"Funds\"); and\n\nWHEREAS, the services provided by FIIOC on behalf of the Funds include responding to inquiries about the Funds including the provision of information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, etc.; and\n\nWHEREAS, Company holds shares of the Funds in order to fund certain variable annuity contracts, group annuity contracts, and/or variable life insurance policies, the beneficial interests in which are held by individuals, plan trustees, or others who look to Company to provide information about the Funds similar to the information provided by FIIOC; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Company and one or more of the Funds have entered into one or more Participation Agreements, under which the Company agrees not to provide information about the Funds except for information provided by the Funds or their designees; and\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC and Company desire that Company be able to respond to inquiries about the Funds from individual variable annuity owners, participants in group annuity contracts issued by the Company, and owners and participants under variable life insurance policies issued by the Company, and prospective customers for any of the above; and\n\nWHEREAS, FIIOC and Company recognize that Company's efforts in responding to customer inquiries will reduce the burden that such inquiries would place on FIIOC should such inquiries be directed to FIIOC.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows:\n\n1. Information to be Provided to Company. FIIOC agrees to provide to Company, on a periodic basis, directly or through a designee, information about the Funds' investment objectives, investment policies, portfolio holdings, performance, etc. The content and format of such information shall be as FIIOC, in its sole discretion, shall choose. FIIOC may change the format and/or content of such informational reports, and the frequency with which such information is provided. For purposes of Section 4.2 of each of the Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, FIIOC represents that it is the designee of the Funds, and Company may therefore use the information provided by FIIOC without seeking additional permission from the Funds.\n\n2. Use of Information by Company. Company may use the information provided by FIIOC in communications to individuals, plan trustees, or others who have legal title or beneficial interest in the annuity or life insurance products issued by Company, or representatives of any of these parties, and to prospective purchasers of such products or beneficial interests thereunder. If such information is contained as part of larger pieces of sales literature, advertising, etc., such pieces shall be furnished for review to the Funds in accordance with the terms of the Company's Participation Agreements with the Funds. Nothing herein shall give the Company the right to expand upon, alter the appearance of, or otherwise alter the information provided by FIIOC. Company acknowledges that the information provided it by FIIOC may\n\n\n\n\n\nneed to be supplemented with additional qualifying information, regulatory disclaimers, or other information before it may be conveyed to persons outside the Company.\n\n3. Compensation to Company. In recognition of the fact that Company will respond to inquiries that otherwise would be handled by FIIOC, FIIOC agrees to pay Company a quarterly fee computed as follows:\n\nAt the close of each calendar quarter, FIIOC will determine the Average Daily Assets held in the Funds by the Company. Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the quarter. The Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that sum shall be divided by four. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for that quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nShould any Participation Agreement(s) between Company and any Fund(s) be terminated effective before the last day of a quarter, Company shall be entitled to a fee for that portion of the quarter during which the Participation Agreement was still in effect, unless such termination is due to misconduct on the part of the Company. For such a stub quarter, Average Daily Assets shall be the sum of the daily assets for each calendar day in the quarter through and including the date of termination of the Participation Agreement(s), divided by the number of calendar days in that quarter for which the Participation Agreement was in effect. Such Average Daily Assets shall be multiplied by [ ] ([ ] basis points) and that number shall be multiplied by the number of days in such quarter that the Participation Agreement was in effect, then divided by three hundred sixty-five. The resulting number shall be the quarterly fee for the stub quarter, which shall be paid to Company during the following month.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, compensation for each calendar quarter will not exceed [ ].\n\n4. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Company at any time upon written notice to FIIOC. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement at any time upon ninety (90) days' written notice to Company. FIIOC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to Company (1) if required by any applicable law or regulation, (2) if so required by action of the Fund(s) Board of Trustees, or (3) if Company engages in any material breach of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon the termination of Company's Participation Agreement(s) with the Funds, and in such event no notice need be given hereunder.\n\n5. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted under and in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n6. Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that it shall be assigned automatically to any successor to FIIOC as the Funds' transfer agent, and any such successor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have set their hands as of the date first written above.\n\nFIDELITY INVESTMENTS INSTITUTIONAL OPERATIONS COMPANY, INC.\n\nBy:\n\nNEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE AND ANNUITY CORPORATION By:\n\nName:\n\nTitle:",
